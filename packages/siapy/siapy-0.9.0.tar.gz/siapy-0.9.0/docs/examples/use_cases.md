### ðŸš€ SiaPy command line tool (CLI)

To facilitate the use of some of the SiaPy library's functionality, a command line interface (CLI) has been implemented.

The CLI currently supports the following commands:

- Display images from two cameras.
- Co-register cameras and compute the transformation from one camera's space to another.
- Select regions in images for training machine learning (ML) models.
- Perform image segmentation using a pre-trained ML model.
- Convert radiance images to reflectance by utilizing a reference panel.
- Display spectral signatures for in-depth analysis.

### ðŸš€ Hyperspectral data utilization in research

This use case demonstrates how to utilize extracted data from hyperspectral images in research.
The project integrates a machine learning (ML) pipeline workflow with the SiaPy library to classify spectral signatures.

Key features:

- Provides a structured approach to train and test models.
- Features an integrated modular architecture for easy modification of models and data.
- Includes an optimization process with hyperparameter tuning.
- Utilizes Explainable AI techniques to understand the model, the data on which the model is trained, and the most relevant spectral bands (important features) for the model.
- Covers the entire process with visualization of results.
