# pyTRLCConverter <!-- omit in toc -->

## Simple Requirement Example With Multiple Sources
The example just shows how requirements in **several files** are converted to Markdown format **without any project specific conversion**. pyTRLCConverter will generate without project specific conversion functions just a simple output. For each source file (\*.trlc) a corresponding output file (\*.md) will be created.
