# Grevling

Grevling (Norwegian for "badger") is a tool for running parameter studies, where
for a given set of parameter values, a sequence of commands are run based on
input files, generating output that should be captured or analyzed. Grevling
intends, in this setting, to replace the ubiquitous bash scripts.

## Usage

To use Grevling most effectively, create a new directory for each study you'd
like to run. In this directory, add all the files you need to run your study,
as well as a file called `grevling.yaml`. This file describes, essentially,
which parameter values to run, how to run a case and which output to capture
for later. Then use `grevling run` to run everything automatically.

Grevling stores captured data in a subdirectory called `.grevlingdata`. It is
safe to delete this directory if anything should go awry. It can be
regenerated with `grevling run`.

Grevling tries to preserve the integrity of the data directory. If you change
the `grevling.yaml` file with a non-empty data directory, Grevling should detect
this and refuse to continue. To fix this, delete the data directory, or run
`grevling check` for more information.

Grevling stores three kinds of data from a run:

- Standard output and error from commands
- Captured files
- Data captured from standard output using regular expressions

In the first two cases, such files can be found in subdirectories of
`.grevlingdata`, one subdirectory per run. For the latter, these are stored in
a Pandas dataframe in `.grevlingdata/dataframe.parquet` using the Apache
Parquet format. The easiest way to load it is by using:

```python
from grevling import Case
data = case.load_dataframe()
```

## Structure of a grevling file

The configuration file is in YAML format. The following gives a whirlwind
tour of the possibilities.

```yaml
# Define which parameters we are interested in
# Grevling will run a case once for each combination of parameters, so runtime
# may be a concern
parameters:

  # Each parameter has a name and a list of values
  parameter: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  # Values may be integers, floats or strings
  float-parameter: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4]
  string-parameter: [one, two, three]

  # For convenience, we can specify a uniform sampling of an interval like this
  # This should generate [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  uniform-parameter:
    type: uniform
    interval: [0.0, 3.0]
    num: 4

  # There is also support for geometrically graded sampling
  graded-parameter:
    type: graded
    interval: [0.0, 1.0]
    num: 5
    grading: 1.2

# We can also define other named values, constants or expressions
evaluate:
  some-constant: 1

  # String values are interpreted as code to be evaluated
  # Parameter values defined above may be given as input
  expression: 2 * parameter

  # Previously defined values can be re-used
  new-expression: 4 / expression

# Templates are files which are read, rendered and then written to the
# temporary working directory set up for each case. When templates are
# rendered, all parameters, constants and expressions above are available.
# Template rendering is achieved using Mako:
# https://www.makotemplates.org/
# Mako is a powerful templating language, a full account of which is out of
# scope here.
templates:
  # This file has the same name in the working directory as in the source directory
  - some-template.txt

  # We can use different filenames too
  - source: input.txt
    target: output.txt

  # We can even use template substitution in the filenames
  - source: my-file-${expression}.txt
    target: output-${parameter}.txt

# Pre-files are also copied to the working directory, but no template
# substitution is performed. This is useful for e.g. binary data files.
prefiles:
  # Otherwise, the same patterns as above are all valid.
  - some-data.dat
  - source: input.dat
    target: output.dat
  - source: my-file-${expression}.dat
    target: output-${parameter}.dat

  # Globbing is supported as well
  # In this case, the target should be a relative subdirectory of the working
  # directory. The default is '.'
  - source: some-files*.txt
    mode: glob

# Post-files work the same way as pre-files, except they are copied back from
# the working directory to the data directory after the script commands are
# finished
postfiles:
  - some-output.hdf5

# This is where the magic happens. A sequence of commands to execute in the working directory
script:
  # A command may be just a string, in which case it is executed via the shell
  - some command to run with arguments

  # Template substitution is allowed here too. Shell escaping will be
  # automatically handled.
  - some command with parameter-dependend arguments ${parameter}

  # We can also specify arguments as a list, in which case the command is
  # executed as a proper subprocess, not via the shell
  - [this, is, the, right, way, to, do, it, in, my, opinion, ${parameter}]

  # More sophisticated uses require us to use this form
  - command: as above

    # A command can optionally be named. By default, the name of a command is
    # the first argument in the list of arguments (that is, the program that is
    # executed). If the program name includes a path, the path is stripped so
    # the name is just the name of the program file.
    name: some-command

    # Stdout and stderr is captured automatically if the command fails. To
    # capture it unconditionally, set this to on.
    capture-output: on

    # To record the runtime of a command, set this to on.
    capture-walltime: on

    # To capture data from stdout we have to define regular expressions
    capture:
      # Use standard Python regular expression syntax
      # https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
      # Any NAMED group will be collected and added to the result
      # This regular expression has groups named a, b and c
      - a=(?P<a>\S+) b=(?P<b>\S+) c=(?P<c>\S+)

      # By default, we find only the last of many possible matches in the
      # output.  This can be changed.
      - pattern: a=(?P<a1>\S+)
        mode: first

      # We can also collect all matches. In this case the result will be a list.
      - pattern: a=(?P<a2>\S+)
        mode: all

      # Since writing regular expressions is tediuos and error-prone, Grevling has
      # some predefined ones.  In this case, we're matching integers...
      - type: integer

        # This is used as the group name
        name: somegroup

        # And this is some text that comes before the integer to match.
        # The resulting regular expression is something like:
        # someint\s*(?P<somegroup>...)
        # where ... matches an integer.
        # This prefix will be safely escaped before use
        prefix: someint

      # Grevling has a predefined regular expression for floats too.
      - type: float
        name: someothergroup
        prefix: somefloat

        # First, last and all also work for these
        mode: all

# The resulting array has entries for every parameter, constant, evaluated
# expression and captured regular expression, as well as walltime for each
# command, if applicable. Grevling is often able to automatically determine the
# type for each of them, but may need help.
# You can use 'grevling check' to see what Grevling thinks the types will be.
types:

  # In particular, Grevling cannot determine the type of regular expression
  # capture groups (except predefined ones).
  # Valid values here are str, int and float
  a1: str
  a2: str

# Finally, various settings
settings:

  # The root folder in which all captured data is stored. Default is ".grevlingdata".
  storagedir: ".grevlingdata"

  # To store captured stdout, stderr and files, Grevling needs to know the name
  # template of a directory to store them. For uniqueness, this template should
  # use all the parameters, or the single 'magic' parameter '_index' which is
  # guaranteed to be unique. This will be a subfolder of storagedir (above).
  logdir: ${parameter}-and-so-on

# Grevling can generate some rudimentary plots based on the generated data.
plots:

  # Each parameter interacts with the plot in a specfic way.
  - parameters:

      # For parameters that are 'fixed', Grevling will produce one separate plot
      # for each of the values of that parameter.
      some-parameter: fixed

      # Parameters that are 'category' will generate multiple graphs in a
      # single plot, differentiated by colors, markers or line styles.
      some-parameter: category

      # Parameters that are designated as 'variate' place their data points
      # in different locations on the x-axis.
      some-parameter: variate

      # If a parameter is 'mean', the data will be averaged over all values of
      # that parameter.
      some-parameter: mean

      # For parameters that are 'ignore', the user asserts that this parameter
      # does NOT influence the data plotted. In this case Grevling will pick an
      # arbitrary value for that parameter. This is the default setting for
      # unmentioned parameters.
      some-parameter: ignore

    # Give the name of the parameter, evaluable or captured result to use for
    # plotting on the x-axis. If this is omitted, and there is exactly one
    # parameter that is 'variate', the value of that parameter will be used.
    # Otherwise, xaxis must be provided. The xaxis value may also be a list type
    # (e.g. from a capture group with mode 'all'), in which case it effetively
    # functions as an additional variate parameter.
    xaxis: something

    # Give the names of the parameters, evaluables or captured results to use
    # for plotting on the y-axis. If there is more than one, this effectively
    # functions as an additional categorical parameter.
    yaxis:
      - first
      - second
      - third

    # For each of the three style categories (color, marker and line) you may
    # either provide a fixed value or tie it to a category (any parameter given
    # as 'category', or 'yaxis' if there are multiple y-axes). For categorical
    # styles, you may also provide a list of values. Grevling will attempt to tie
    # categorical parameters to styles automatically if not explicitly provided.
    style:
      color:
        category: some-parameter
      line: solid
      marker:
        category: yaxis
        values: [circle, square, triangle]

    # If there are more than one effective variate parameters (that is, including
    # the 'xaxis' specification), the default plot style is 'scatter'. Otherwise
    # it is 'line'.
    type: line

    # For the filename template you can use any parameter values designated as
    # 'fixed', or evaluables that only depend on such. Don't add a file extension.
    # The plots are stored in the .grevlingdata folder.
    filename: plot-${some-parameter}

    # Specify the backends to use. Some are optional dependencies!

                     # pip install plotly>=4
      - csv          # For use with e.g. Excel or TiKZ/PGFPlots

    # For these you can use templates that depend on fixed and/or categorical
    # parameters, as the case may be.
