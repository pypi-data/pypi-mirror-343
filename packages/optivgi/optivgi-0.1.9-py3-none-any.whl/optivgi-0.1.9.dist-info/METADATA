              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Opti-VGI: EV Smart Charging Scheduler Application

Opti-VGI is an EV smart charging management application designed to optimize electric vehicle charging based on power or pricing constraints. It provides a flexible framework whose scheduling logic can integrate with Charge Station Management Systems (CSMS). The specific integration method, potentially supporting protocols like OCPP 1.6 or OCPP 2.0.1 / ISO 15118, depends on the implementation of its communication layer.

**Documentation:** [https://argonne-vci.github.io/Opti-VGI](https://argonne-vci.github.io/Opti-VGI)

---

## Key Features

*   **Constraint-Based Optimization:** Schedules EV charging considering factors like overall site power limits or dynamic pricing signals.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Clearly separates communication logic (`Translation` layer) from optimization strategies (`Algorithm` layer).
*   **Pluggable Algorithms:** Supports different optimization approaches. Includes implementations like:
    *   `PulpNumericalAlgorithm`: Uses linear programming via the PuLP library.
    *   `GoAlgorithm`: A custom heuristic-based algorithm.
*   **CSMS Integration Interface:** The `Translation` abstract class defines the necessary methods to fetch data (EVs, constraints) and send charging commands, allowing integration with various external systems. The implementation of this layer determines how Opti-VGI communicates (e.g., via API calls, database interaction, or specific protocols like OCPP).
*   **Handles Active & Future EVs:** Considers both currently connected EVs and planned future reservations in its scheduling.
*   **Asynchronous Operation:** Designed to run scheduling logic periodically or in response to events using background worker threads.

---

## Architecture Overview

Opti-VGI follows a modular design:

1.  **Translation Layer (`optivgi.translation`):** An abstract interface (`Translation`) for communication with external systems (e.g., a CSMS). Implementations handle fetching EV data, power constraints, and sending charging profiles. **This is where specific communication protocols (like OCPP methods via a library, or custom API calls) would be implemented.**
2.  **SCM Runner (`optivgi.scm_runner`):** Orchestrates the scheduling cycle, using a `Translation` instance to get inputs, an `Algorithm` instance to calculate schedules, and the `Translation` instance again to dispatch results.
3.  **SCM Algorithm (`optivgi.scm.algorithm`):** An abstract interface (`Algorithm`) for charging strategies. Concrete implementations contain the core optimization logic (e.g., `GoAlgorithm`, `PulpNumericalAlgorithm`).
4.  **EV Data Structure (`optivgi.scm.ev`):** A standard dataclass (`EV`) representing vehicles and their charging parameters.
5.  **Worker Threads (`optivgi.threads`):** Helpers to run the SCM logic periodically or on events without blocking the main application.

### Sequence Diagram

![Sequence Diagram](docs/source/_static/sequence-diagram.svg)

The diagram shows the flow of data and commands between the EVSEs, Opti-VGI, and the CSMS, highlighting the roles of the ``Translation`` and ``Algorithm`` layers in this interaction.
It illustrates how Opti-VGI fetches data from the CSMS, processes it using the selected algorithm, and sends back charging commands.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install optivgi
```

For development, clone the repository and install with development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/argonne-vci/Opti-VGI.git
cd Opti-VGI
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Usage & Examples

Opti-VGI provides the core scheduling framework. To use it, you need to:

1.  **Implement the `Translation` interface:** Create a concrete class that inherits from `optivgi.translation.Translation` and implements the `get_evs`, `get_peak_power_demand`, and `send_power_to_evs` methods to communicate with your specific CSMS or data source.
2.  **Choose an `Algorithm`:** Select one of the provided algorithms (e.g., `GoAlgorithm`, `PulpNumericalAlgorithm`) or implement your own inheriting from `optivgi.scm.algorithm.Algorithm`.
3.  **Run the `scm_worker`:** Use the `optivgi.threads.scm_worker` function in a separate thread, providing your `Translation` implementation and chosen `Algorithm` class. Trigger the worker using an event queue.

An example demonstrating integration via a simple HTTP API and WebSocket notifications can be found in the [`./examples/http-api/`](./examples/http-api/) directory. See the [Examples Documentation](https://argonne-vci.github.io/Opti-VGI/examples/index.html) for more details.
