\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org8cd0584}

Arbor's model of the neurite -- and similarly that of cable theory in general --
is valid in a narrow region around the membrane, ie \(r_{m} - \epsilon \leq r
\leq r_{m} - \epsilon\). Therefore, the state variables of the model -- in
particular ionic concentrations and currents -- are defined only in said small
region.

For treating diffusion of ionic species along the axial direction of the neuron,
however, we will either need to assume a radially homogeneous distribution of
ions inside the cell plasma or resort to a more detailed model of the general
dynamics.

Therefore, in the axial diffusion model adopted by Arbor, we are going to assume
that the concentration \(M_s\) of an ionic species \(s\) behaves like \(M_s(x, r,
\theta) = M_s(x)\) and is defined on the full inside of the neuron \(0 \leq r <
r_m\). Furthermore, in contrast to traditional cable theory, we will take into
account the effect trans-membrane currents on the internal concentration when
modelling diffusion, ie

\begin{align*}
\partial_{t} M_{s} = \nabla \cdot (D_{s} \nabla M_{s}) + I_{m,s}
\end{align*}

This makes the axial diffusion model richer than the plain cable theory approach
as implemented in Arbor so far. In particular the cable model assumes internal
(and external) concentrations to be defined in a thin shell around the membrane
and to be buffered by a far larger volume away from that shell. Thus, these
values are reset to the buffer value infinitely fast, ie every time step in
Arbor, unless managed by a concentration model density mechanism. However, this
makes diffusion impossible as mechanisms cannot not exchange data across CVs.
Therefore, finally!, we chose to add a new quantity \texttt{Xd} that is not buffered
and serves as a diffusing proxy concentration that can be coupled by a mechanism
to the internal concentration if needed. This begets an awkward, but workable,
interface with ODE models of \texttt{Xd} in NMODL, see the relevant documentation.

This proxy will be initialised as \texttt{Xd = Xi} and present on the full morphology
iff \(\D_{s} > 0\) on any non-vanishing subset of the morphology.

\section{Derivation and FVM}
\label{sec:org06e2271}

The cable equation is the foundation of Arbor's model of the neuron
\begin{align*}
    c_{m} \partial_{t} V = \frac{1}{2 \pi a} \partial_{x} \left(\frac{\pi a^{2}}{R_{L}} \partial_{x} V\right) + i_{m}
\end{align*}
We want to solve the diffusion equation, excluding currents for now,
\begin{align*}
\partial_{t} M = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla M)
\end{align*}
by application of the finite volume method (as for the cable equation). That is,
we average over the control volume (CV) \(V\) to rewrite in terms of the average
concentration \(\bar{M}\) and apply Stoke's theorem on the right hand side. Note
that we suppress the species subscript \(s\) for clarity where obvious from
context or not relevant to the discussion. Thus
\begin{align*}
\partial_{t} \bar M_{i} = \frac{1}{\Delta V_{i}}\int\limits_{\partial V} \mathrm{d}a \cdot D \nabla M
\end{align*}
For linking to NMODL, note that \(M\) is identified with \texttt{Xd} in this discussion.
Note that \(\nabla \sim \partial_{x}\) in our 1.5d model.

Next, we define the fluxes
\begin{align*}
F_{ij} = \sigma_{ij}(\bar M_{i} - \bar M_{j})
\end{align*}
where \(\sigma_{ij}\) is the contact area of segments \(i\) and \(j\).

Then we apply an implicit Euler time-step
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(M^{k+1} - M^{k}\right) = \sum_{j}\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{P_{L}\Delta x_{ij}}\eta_{ij} \left(M_{i}^{k+1} - M_{j}^{k+1}\right)
\end{align*}
where \(\eta_{ij} = 1\) if \(i\) and \(j\) are neighbours and zero otherwise. We introduced
\(P_L = P \cdot A/l\) where \(P = 1/D\) in analogy with \(R_{L}\) ('\emph{specific diffusive
resistivity}').

This can be rewritten to expose the structure of the linear system more clearly
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\Delta t}M_{i}^{k}= \frac{1}{\Delta t}M_{i}^{k+1} + \sum\limits_{j}\beta_{ij} \left(M_{i}^{k+1} - M_{j}^{k+1} \right)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
\beta_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{P_{L} \Delta x_{ij}}\eta_{ij}
\end{align*}

\section{Treatment of Trans-Membrane Ion Flux}
\label{sec:org0eeed52}

Finally, we add back the ionic currents to the concentration changes to arrive at
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\Delta t}M_{i}^{k} = \left(\frac{1}{\Delta t}
 + \sum\limits_{j}\beta_{ij}\right) M_{i}^{k+1} - \sum\limits_{j}\beta_{ij}M_{j}^{k+1} + \frac{\sigma_{i}}{q I_m(V^{k+1
})
\end{align*}
where we used the CV surface \(\sigma_{i}\), the ion species' current \(I_m\) through
\(\sigma_{i}\) and its charge \(q\).

We follow Arbor's model and write Ohm's law
\begin{align*}
g = \frac{\partial I_m(V)}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial t}{\partial V}\frac{\partial I_m}{\partial t}
\end{align*}
where \(g\) is the \emph{per species conductivity} and approximately we have
\begin{align*}
I_m^{k+1} - I_m^{k} = g\left(V^{k+1} - V^{k}\right)
\end{align*}
Inserting this into the diffusion equation and rearranging to separate
\(\cdot^{k}\) and \(\cdot^{k+1}\) terms
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\Delta t}M_{i}^{k} - \frac{\sigma_{i}}{q}\left(I_m^k - gV^k\right)= \left(\frac{1}{\Delta t}
 + \sum\limits_{j}\beta_{ij}\right) M_{i}^{k+1} - \sum\limits_{j}\beta_{ij}M_{j}^{k+1} + \frac{\sigma_{i}g}{q} V^{k+1}
\end{align*}

In \texttt{fvm\_discretize} we compute \(\alpha_{ij}\) -- the analogue for \(\beta_{ij}\) in the cable
equation -- called \texttt{face\_conductance} in code
\begin{verbatim}
mcable span{bid, parent_refpt, cv_refpt};
double resistance =
    embedding.integrate_ixa(span,
                            D.axial_resistivity[0].at(bid));
D.face_conductance[i] = 100/resistance; // 100 scales to ÂµS.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Units}
\label{sec:org4ff2b42}

We have the following units preset for us

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
Quantity & Symbol & Unit & SI\\
\hline
Concentration & \(M\) & \(m\mathrm{mol}/l\) & \(10^{-6} \mathrm{mol}/m^{3}\)\\
Length & \(x\) & \(\mu m\) & \(10^{-6} m\)\\
Area & \(A\) & \((\mu m)^{2}\) & \(10^{-12} m^{2}\)\\
Time & \(t\) & \(ms\) & \(10^{-3} s\)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

From this we need to fix units for
\begin{itemize}
\item fluxes \(F\)
\item diffusivity \(D\) and \(D_{L}\)
\item diffusive resistivity \(P\) and \(P_{L}\)
\end{itemize}

We start with \(D\) and apply dimensional analysis to the diffusion equation to note
\begin{align*}
[M]/[T] &= [M][D]/[L^{2}]\\
\end{align*}
which results in
\begin{align*}
[D] &= [L^{2}][T]^{-1}\\
&= (\mu m)^{2}/ms = 10^{-9} m^{2}/ s
\end{align*}
in Arbor's internal units.
Similarly, we rewrite the diffusion equation in its abstract form
\begin{align*}
\partial_{t} M = \nabla \cdot F
\end{align*}
to arrive at
\begin{align*}
[M]/[T] &= [F]/[L]\\
\Leftrightarrow [F] &= [L][M][T]^{-1}\\
\Rightarrow [F] &= 10^{-9} \mathrm{mol}/(m^{2} s)
\end{align*}

From Yasuda et al we have \([D_{eff}] = 10^{-12}m^{2}/s\) which fits our derivation
for \(D\), expect for their use of \([T] = s\) as opposed to \([T]=ms\).
