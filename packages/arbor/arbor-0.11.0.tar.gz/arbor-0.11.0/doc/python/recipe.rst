Recipes
=================

.. currentmodule:: arbor

The :class:`recipe` class documentation is below.

A recipe describes neuron models in a cell-oriented manner and supplies methods to provide cell information.
Details on why Arbor uses recipes and general best practices can be found in :ref:`modelrecipe`.

Recipe
------

.. class:: recipe

    Describe a model by describing the cells and network, without any information about how the model is to be represented or executed.

    All recipes derive from this abstract base class.
    
    Recipes provide a cell-centric interface for describing a model.
    This means that model properties, such as connections, are queried using the global identifier ``gid`` of a cell.
    In the description below, the term ``gid`` is used as shorthand for the cell with a global identifier.

    **Required Constructor**

    The constructor must be implemented and call the base class constructor, as at the moment, there is no way
    to instruct Python to do that automatically.
    
    .. note:: 
        Arbor's Python binding is a thin wrapper around the Arbor library, which is written in C++.
        Calling the base class constructor ensures correct initialization of memory in the underlying C++ class.
    
    A minimal constructor therefore looks like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        def __init__(self):
            arbor.recipe.__init__(self)

    **Required Member Functions**

    The following member functions (besides a constructor) must be implemented by every recipe:

    .. function:: num_cells()

        The number of cells in the model.

    .. function:: cell_kind(gid)

        The cell kind of the cell with global identifier ``gid`` (return type: :class:`arbor.cell_kind`).

    .. function:: cell_description(gid)

        A high-level description of the cell with global identifier ``gid``,
        for example, the morphology, synapses, and ion channels required to build a multi-compartment neuron.
        The type used to describe a cell depends on the kind of the cell.
        The interface for querying the kind and description of a cell is separate
        to allow the cell type to be provided without building a full cell description,
        which can be very expensive.

    **Optional Member Functions**

    .. function:: connections_on(gid)

        Returns a list of all the **incoming** connections to ``gid``. Each
        connection should have a valid synapse label ``connection.dest`` on the
        post-synaptic target ``gid``, and a valid source label
        ``connection.source.label`` on the pre-synaptic source
        ``connection.source.gid``. See :class:`cell_connection`.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: external_connections_on(gid)

        Returns a list of all the **incoming** connections to ``gid`` from a
        remote simulation. Each connection should have a valid synapse label
        ``connection.dest`` on the post-synaptic target ``gid``, and a valid
        source label ``connection.source.lid`` on the pre-synaptic source
        ``connection.source.gid``. See :class:`connection`. Note that in
        contrast to :class:`connection`, this uses two numeric identifiers
        for the source instead.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: network_description()

        Returns a network description, consisting of a network selection, network value for
        weight and delay, and a network dictionary.

        By default returns none.

    .. function:: gap_junctions_on(gid)

        Returns a list of all the gap junctions connected to ``gid``.
        Each gap junction ``gj`` should have a valid gap junction site label ``gj.local`` on ``gid``,
        and a valid gap junction site label ``gj.peer.label`` on ``gj.peer.gid``.
        See :class:`gap_junction_connection`.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: event_generators(gid)

        A list of all the :class:`event_generator` s that are attached to ``gid``.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: probes(gid)

        Returns a list specifying the probesets describing probes on the cell ``gid``.
        Each element in the list is an opaque object of type :class:`probe` produced by
        cell kind-specific probeset functions. Each probeset in the list
        has a corresponding probeset id of type :class:`cell_member`: an id ``(gid, i)``
        refers to the probes described by the ith entry in the list returned by ``get_probes(gid)``.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: global_properties(kind)

        The global properties of a model.

        This method needs to be implemented for :class:`arbor.cell_kind.cable`, where the
        properties include ion concentrations and reversal potentials; initial membrane voltage;
        temperature; axial resistivity; membrane capacitance; cv_policy; and a pointer
        to the mechanism catalogue. Also see :ref:`mechanisms_builtins`.

        By default returns an empty object.

    .. function:: cell_isometry(gid)

        Returns an isometry consisting of translation and rotation, which is applied to cell morphology to resolve global locations.

        By default, it returns an isometry without translation and rotation.

Event generator and schedules
-----------------------------

.. class:: event_generator

    .. function:: event_generator(target, weight, schedule)

        Construct an event generator for a :attr:`target` synapse with :attr:`weight` of the events to
        deliver based on a schedule (i.e., :class:`arbor.regular_schedule`, :class:`arbor.explicit_schedule`,
        :class:`arbor.poisson_schedule`).

    .. attribute:: target

        The target synapse of type :class:`arbor.cell_local_label`.

    .. attribute:: weight

        The weight delivered to the target synapse. It is up to the target mechanism to interpret this quantity.
        For Arbor-supplied point processes, such as the ``expsyn`` synapse, a weight of ``1`` corresponds to an
        increase in conductivity in the target mechanism of ``1`` Î¼S (micro-Siemens).

.. class:: regular_schedule

    Describes a regular schedule with multiples of :attr:`dt` within the interval [:attr:`tstart`, :attr:`tstop`).

    .. function:: regular_schedule(tstart, dt, tstop)

        Construct a regular schedule as list of times from :attr:`tstart` to :attr:`tstop` in :attr:`dt` time steps.

        By default returns a schedule with :attr:`tstart` = :attr:`tstop` = ``None`` and :attr:`dt` = 0 ms.

    .. attribute:: tstart

        The delivery time of the first event in the sequence [ms].
        Must be non-negative or ``None``.

    .. attribute:: dt

        The interval between time points [ms].
        Must be non-negative.

    .. attribute:: tstop

        No events will be delivered after this time [ms].
        Must be non-negative or ``None``.

    .. function:: events(t0, t1)

        Returns a view of monotonically increasing time values in the half-open interval [t0, t1).

.. class:: explicit_schedule

    Describes an explicit schedule at a predetermined (sorted) sequence of :attr:`times`.

    .. function:: explicit_schedule(times)

        Construct an explicit schedule.

        By default returns a schedule with an empty list of times.

    .. attribute:: times

        The list of non-negative times [ms].

    .. function:: events(t0, t1)

        Returns a view of monotonically increasing time values in the half-open interval [t0, t1).

.. class:: poisson_schedule

    Describes a schedule according to a Poisson process.

    .. function:: poisson_schedule(tstart, freq, seed)

        Construct a Poisson schedule.

        By default returns a schedule with events starting from :attr:`tstart` = 0 ms,
        with an expected frequency :attr:`freq` = 10 kHz and :attr:`seed` = 0.

    .. attribute:: tstart

        The delivery time of the first event in the sequence [ms].

    .. attribute:: freq

        The expected frequency [kHz].

    .. attribute:: seed

        The seed for the random number generator.

    .. function:: events(t0, t1)

        Returns a view of monotonically increasing time values in the half-open interval [t0, t1).

    .. attribute:: tstop

        No events will be delivered after this time [ms].

An example of an event generator reads as follows:

.. container:: example-code

    .. code-block:: python

        import arbor as A

        # define a Poisson schedule with a start time at 1 ms, expected frequency of 5 Hz,
        # and the target cell's gid as seed

        def event_generators(gid):
            # label of the synapse on target cell, if multiple distribute cyclically
            target = A.cell_local_label("syn", A.selection_policy.round_robin)
            # Poisson schedule with a start time, event rate, and the target cell's gid as seed.
            sched  = A.poisson_schedule(tstart=1*U.ms, freq=5*U.Hz, seed=gid)
            # Weight to apply to the events
            weight = 0.1
            return [A.event_generator(target, weight, sched)]

Example
-------

Below is an example of a recipe construction of a ring network of multi-compartmental cells.
Because the interface for specifying cable morphology cells is under construction, the temporary
helpers in cell_parameters and make_cable_cell for building cells are used.

.. container:: example-code

    .. code-block:: python

        import sys
        import arbor as A

        class ring_recipe (A.recipe):

            def __init__(self, n=4):
                # The base C++ class constructor must be called first, to ensure that
                # all memory in the C++ class is initialized correctly.
                A.recipe.__init__(self)
                self.ncells = n
                self.params = A.cell_parameters()

            # The num_cells method that returns the total number of cells in the model
            # must be implemented.
            def num_cells(self):
                return self.ncells

            # The cell_description method returns a cell.
            def cell_description(self, gid):
                # Cell should have a synapse labeled "syn"
                # and a detector labeled "detector"
                return make_cable_cell(gid, self.params)

            # The kind method returns the type of cell with gid.
            # Note: this must agree with the type returned by cell_description.
            def cell_kind(self, gid):
                return A.cell_kind.cable

            # Make a ring network
            def connections_on(self, gid):
                src = (gid-1)%self.ncells
                w = 0.01
                d = 10 * U.ms
                return [A.connection((src,"detector"), "syn", w, d)]

            # Attach a generator to the first cell in the ring.
            def event_generators(self, gid):
                if gid==0:
                    sched = A.explicit_schedule([1*U.ms])
                    return [A.event_generator("syn", 0.1, sched)]
                return []

            def get_probes(self, id):
                # Probe just the membrane voltage at a location on the soma.
                return [A.cable_probe_membrane_voltage('(location 0 0)')]
