A ring network
==============

In this example, a small network of cells arranged in a ring will be created, and the simulation will be distributed over multiple threads or GPUs, if available.

.. Note::

   **Concepts covered in this example:**

   1. Building a basic :py:class:`arbor.cell` with a synapse site and spike generator.
   2. Building an :py:class:`arbor.recipe` with a network of interconnected cells.
   3. Running the simulation and extracting the results.

The cell
********

Step **(1)** shows a function that creates a simple cell with a dendrite.
We construct the following :term:`morphology` and label the soma and dendrite:

.. figure:: ../gen-images/tutorial_network_ring_morph.svg
   :width: 400
   :align: center

   A 4-segment cell with a soma (pink) and a branched dendrite (light blue).

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 12-42

In step **(2)** we create a :term:`label` for both the root and the site of the synapse.
These locations will form the endpoints of the connections between the cells.

.. figure:: ../gen-images/tutorial_network_ring_synapse_site.svg
   :width: 400
   :align: center

   We'll create labels for the root (red) and a synapse_site (black).

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 44-54

After we've created a basic :py:class:`arbor.decor`, step **(3)** places a synapse with an exponential decay (``'expsyn'``) on the ``'synapse_site'``.
The synapse is given the label ``'syn'``, which is later used to form :py:class:`arbor.connection` objects terminating *at* the cell.

.. Note::
   Mechanisms can be initialized with their name; ``'expsyn'`` is short for ``arbor.mechanism('expsyn')``.
   Mechanisms typically have some parameters, which can be queried (see :py:class:`arbor.mechanism_info`) and set
   (see :py:class:`arbor.mechanism`). In particular, the ``e`` parameter of ``expsyn`` defaults to ``0``, which makes it,
   given the typical resting potential of cell membranes of ``-70 mV``, an excitatory synapse.

Step **(4)** places a threshold detector at the ``'root'``. The detector is given the label ``'detector'``, which is later used to form
:py:class:`arbor.connection` objects originating *from* the cell.

.. Note::

   The number of synapses placed on the cell in this case is 1, because the ``'synapse_sites'`` locset is an explicit location.
   Had the chosen locset contained multiple locations, an equal number of synapses would have been placed, all given the same label ``'syn'``.

   The same explanation applies to the number of detectors on this cell.

The recipe
**********

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 70-112

To create a model with multiple connected cells, we need to use a
:py:class:`recipe <arbor.recipe>`. The recipe is where the different cells and
the :ref:`connections <interconnectivity>` between them are defined.

Step **(5)** shows a class definition for a recipe with multiple cells.
Instantiating the class requires the desired number of cells as input. Compared
to the :ref:`simple cell recipe <tutorialsinglecellrecipe>`, the main
differences are connecting the cells **(8)**, returning a configurable number of
cells **(6)** and returning a new cell per ``gid`` **(7)**.

Step **(8)** creates an :py:class:`arbor.connection` between consecutive cells.
If a cell has gid ``gid``, the previous cell has a gid ``(gid-1)%self.ncells``.
The connection has a weight of 0.01 (inducing a conductance of 0.01 Î¼S in the
target mechanism ``expsyn``) and a delay of 5 ms. The first two arguments to
:py:class:`arbor.connection` are the **source** and **target** of the
connection.

The **source** is an :py:class:`arbor.cell_global_label` object containing a cell
index ``gid``, the source label corresponding to a valid detector label on the
cell and an optional selection policy (for choosing a single detector out of
potentially many detectors grouped under the same label - remember, in this case
the number of detectors labeled 'detector' is 1). The
:py:class:`arbor.cell_global_label` can be initialized with a ``(gid, label)``
tuple, in which case the selection policy is the default
:py:attr:`arbor.selection_policy.univalent`; or a ``(gid, (label, policy))``
tuple.

The **target** is a :py:class:`arbor.cell_local_label` object containing a cell
index ``gid``, the target label corresponding to a valid synapse label on the
cell and an optional selection policy (for choosing a single synapse out of
potentially many synapses grouped under the same label - remember, in this case
the number of synapses labeled 'syn' is 1). The
:py:class:`arbor.cell_local_label` can be initialized with a ``label`` string,
in which case the selection policy is the default
:py:attr:`arbor.selection_policy.univalent`; or a ``(label, policy)`` tuple. The
``gid`` of the target cell doesn't need to be explicitly added to the
connection, it is the argument to the :py:func:`arbor.recipe.connections_on`
method.

Step **(9)** attaches an :py:class:`arbor.event_generator` on the 0th target
(synapse) on the 0th cell; this means it is connected to the ``"synapse_site"``
on cell 0. This initiates the signal cascade through the network. The
:class:`arbor.explicit_schedule` in instantiated with a list of times in
milliseconds, so here a single event at the 1 ms mark is emitted. Note that this
synapse is connected twice, once to the event generator, and once to another
cell.

Step **(10)** places a :term:`probe` at the ``"root"`` of each cell.

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 115-117

Step **(11)** instantiates the recipe with 4 cells.

The execution
*************

To create a simulation, we need at minimum to supply the recipe, and in addition
can supply a :class:`arbor.context` and :py:class:`arbor.domain_decomposition`.
The first lets Arbor know what hardware it should use, the second how to
destribute the work over that hardware. By default, contexts are configured to
use 1 thread and domain decompositons to divide work equally over all threads.

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 119-137

Step **(12)** creates a simulation object from the recipe. Optionally, the
:py:class:`~arbor.simulation` constructor takes two more parameters: a
:class:`arbor.context` and a :class:`arbor.domain_decomposition`. In :ref:`a
followup of this tutorial <tutorialgpu>` that will be demonstrated. For now, it
is enough to know that for simulations that don't require customized execution
those arguments can be left out. Without further arguments Arbor will use all
locally available threads.

Step **(13)** sets all spike generators to record using the
:py:class:`arbor.spike_recording.all` policy. This means the timestamps of the
generated events will be kept in memory. Be default, these are discarded.

In addition to having the timestamps of spikes, we want to extract the voltage as a function of time.

Step **(14)** sets the probes (step **10**) to measure at a certain schedule. This is sometimes described as
attaching a :term:`sampler` to a :term:`probe`. :py:func:`arbor.simulation.sample` expects a :term:`probeset id` and the
desired schedule (here: a recording frequency of 10 kHz, or a ``dt`` of 0.1 ms). Note that the probeset id is a separate index from those of
:term:`connection` endpoints; probeset ids correspond to the index of the list produced by
:py:func:`arbor.recipe.probes` on cell ``gid``.

:py:func:`arbor.simulation.sample` returns a handle to the :term:`samples <sample>` that will be recorded. We store
these handles for later use.

Step **(15)** executes the simulation for a duration of 100 ms.

The results
***********

Step **(16)** prints the timestamps of the spikes:

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 139-142

Step **(17)** generates a plot of the sampling data.
:py:func:`arbor.simulation.samples` takes a ``handle`` of the probe we wish to examine. It returns a list
of ``(data, meta)`` terms: ``data`` being the time and value series of the probed quantity; and
``meta`` being the location of the probe. The size of the returned list depends on the number of
discrete locations pointed to by the handle, which in this case is 1, so we can take the first element.
(Recall that in step **(10)** we attached a probe to the ``"root"``, which describes one location.
It could have described a :term:`locset`.)

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/example/network_ring.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 144-

Since we have created ``ncells`` cells, we have ``ncells`` traces. We should be seeing phase shifted traces, as the action potential propagated through the network.

We plot the results using pandas and seaborn:
