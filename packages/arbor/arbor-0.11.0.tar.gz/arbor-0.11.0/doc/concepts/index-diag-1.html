    An overview of Arbor at the highest level. The layout reflects a division
    that is core to Arbor: the science is described entirely separate from the
    execution of the simulation.

    The Recipe describes the network by declaring its constituent cells and
    their connections in addition to the stimuli and data extraction.
    </br>
    Execution is determined by mapping out the available hardware in a context
    as processes (via MPI) plus the threads and GPUs associated with each process.
    </br>
    Finally, a domain decomposition maps the network onto said resources taking into
    account the capabilities of each cell type.
