# Basking.io SDK

Integrate your data with the Basking API, customize the reports & experience,
and join the community of developers building with workplace software apps together with Basking.

Basking.io is a cloud based workplace occupancy platform.
More Information about Basking can be found here: https://basking.io

Basking uses a GraphQL API. The following Python SDK is a wrapper around the production API
designed for our customers that require to access to data programmatically.

## Requirements

* python >=3.7 (current tested version: 3.9)
* pipenv
* A [basking.io account](https://app.basking.io)

## Getting started

#### set the following environment variables:
* `BASKING_USERNAME`: Your username (usually your email)
* `BASKING_USER_PASSWORD`: Your password for Basking. 
* _Optional_: `BASKING_AWS_REGION`: the aws region where your Basking.io instance is hosted. (Defaults to `eu-central-1`)
* _Optional_: `BASKING_API_URL`: the url of the Basking API you would like to query. (Defaults to `api.basking.io`)
