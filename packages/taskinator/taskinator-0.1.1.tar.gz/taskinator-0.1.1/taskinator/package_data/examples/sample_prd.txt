# Sample Task Management System PRD

## Overview
Create a simple task management system that allows users to organize and track their work items efficiently.

## Core Requirements

1. Task Creation and Management
   - Users can create new tasks with titles and descriptions
   - Tasks can be assigned priorities (low, medium, high)
   - Tasks can have dependencies on other tasks
   - Tasks can be broken down into subtasks

2. Status Tracking
   - Tasks can be marked as pending, in progress, blocked, or done
   - Status changes should respect task dependencies
   - Visual indicators for task status in the UI

3. User Interface
   - Command-line interface for all operations
   - Clear and intuitive commands
   - Rich terminal output with colors and formatting
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations

4. Data Management
   - Tasks stored in both JSON and individual text files
   - Consistent file format for task details
   - Automatic file generation and updates
   - Data validation and error handling

## Technical Requirements

1. Code Structure
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Type safety and input validation
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Well-documented code and APIs

2. Testing
   - Unit tests for all core functionality
   - Integration tests for system components
   - Test coverage reporting
   - Mocked external services in tests

3. Dependencies
   - Minimal external dependencies
   - Clear documentation of requirements
   - Version compatibility management
   - Easy installation process

4. Performance
   - Fast response times for all operations
   - Efficient file operations
   - Proper handling of large task sets
   - Asynchronous processing where appropriate

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use modern Python features and best practices
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
3. Implement proper logging and debugging
4. Provide clear error messages and user feedback
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing task files
6. Document all commands and configuration options

## Success Criteria

1. All core features implemented and tested
2. Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
3. Clear and complete documentation
4. Smooth installation and setup process
5. Efficient and reliable operation
6. Positive user feedback on usability
