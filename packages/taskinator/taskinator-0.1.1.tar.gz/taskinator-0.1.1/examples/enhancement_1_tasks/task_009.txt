# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Sync Status Indicators
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5 (done)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add visual indicators for task synchronization status in the user interface.

# Details:
Implement status indicators for each task showing sync status (synced, pending, conflict). Add system-wide sync status indicators. Create notifications for completed syncs and errors. Ensure indicators are updated in real-time as sync status changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test status indicators with various sync states. Verify that indicators update correctly after sync operations. Test with mock sync processes to cover all status conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Individual Task Sync Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create visual indicators for each task showing its synchronization status (synced, pending, conflict).
### Details:
Design and implement status icons that appear next to each task in the task list. Use different colors and symbols for each state: green checkmark for 'synced', yellow clock for 'pending', red exclamation for 'conflict'. Add tooltips that explain the status when hovering. Ensure the indicators are accessible and follow design system guidelines. Update the task component to include these indicators and modify the task model to include a syncStatus field.

## 2. Create System-Wide Sync Status Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Implement a global indicator showing the overall synchronization status of the application.
### Details:
Add a persistent indicator in the application header or footer that shows the overall sync status. Create notification toasts for completed syncs and errors that appear temporarily. Design a sync details panel that can be expanded to show more information about recent sync activities. Implement a sync history log accessible from settings. Ensure all system-wide indicators follow the same visual language as the individual task indicators.

## 3. Develop Real-Time Status Update Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a system that updates all sync status indicators in real-time as synchronization status changes.
### Details:
Implement an event-based system to listen for sync status changes from the backend. Set up a state management solution to track sync status across the application. Create animation transitions between different status states for smooth visual feedback. Implement debouncing to prevent UI flickering during rapid status changes. Add automated status updates on network connectivity changes. Test thoroughly with different network conditions, including offline scenarios and intermittent connectivity.
