# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add Support for Incremental Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5 (done)
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize synchronization by implementing incremental updates and efficient change detection.

# Details:
Implement efficient change detection to identify modified tasks. Create a system for tracking changes since last sync. Add support for pagination when dealing with large task sets. Optimize API usage to minimize data transfer.

# Test Strategy:
Test incremental updates with various change scenarios. Measure performance with large task sets. Verify that only changed data is transferred during sync.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Efficient Change Detection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: low
### Description: Create an algorithm to detect changes in tasks since the last synchronization
### Details:
Develop a hashing or timestamp-based mechanism to identify modified tasks. Use a combination of last modified timestamps and content hashing to detect changes. Implement comparison logic between local and remote task states. Create unit tests to verify the change detection accuracy under different scenarios.

## 2. Build Last-Sync Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Priority: low
### Description: Develop a system to track and store the timestamp of the last successful synchronization
### Details:
Create a persistent storage mechanism for last sync timestamps. Implement methods to update this timestamp after successful syncs. Design recovery mechanisms if sync fails midway. Add logging for sync history to aid debugging. Ensure the system works across app restarts.

## 3. Add Pagination Support for Large Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Priority: low
### Description: Implement pagination to handle large sets of tasks efficiently
### Details:
Modify API request handlers to support pagination parameters. Implement cursor-based pagination for optimal performance. Create a mechanism to merge paginated results into a complete dataset. Add progress indicators for users during multi-page synchronization. Implement error handling for interrupted pagination sequences.

## 4. Optimize API Usage for Minimal Data Transfer [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Priority: low
### Description: Reduce data transfer by optimizing API requests and responses
### Details:
Implement request compression if supported by the API. Create selective field fetching to only retrieve necessary data. Design batching mechanisms for multiple small changes. Implement throttling to prevent API rate limits. Add metrics to measure and report on data transfer efficiency improvements.
