# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Conflict Resolution Strategies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2 (done), 5 (done)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create configurable conflict resolution strategies for handling conflicting changes.

# Details:
Implement multiple conflict resolution strategies: newest wins, local wins, remote wins, and manual resolution. Add version tracking to detect conflicts. Create a system for presenting conflicts to users when manual resolution is needed. Store resolution preferences for future conflicts.

# Test Strategy:
Test each resolution strategy with various conflict scenarios. Verify that user preferences are respected. Test the conflict detection system with edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Version Tracking System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a version tracking system to detect conflicts between local and remote changes
### Details:
Design and implement a version tracking mechanism that assigns unique identifiers to each change. This should include timestamps and possibly a change sequence number. Implement logic to compare versions and determine if changes conflict. The system should track the base version that changes were made against and the current version after changes.

## 2. Develop Automatic Resolution Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Implement the three automatic conflict resolution strategies: newest wins, local wins, and remote wins
### Details:
Create a strategy pattern implementation for conflict resolution with concrete implementations for each strategy type. For 'newest wins', compare timestamps and select the most recent change. For 'local wins', always preserve local changes. For 'remote wins', always accept remote changes. Each strategy should receive conflict information and return a resolved state. Include unit tests for each strategy.

## 3. Build Manual Resolution UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create UI components for users to manually resolve conflicts when needed
### Details:
Design and implement UI components that display conflicting values side by side (local vs. remote) with options to select either version or merge them. Include diff visualization for text-based conflicts. Create form elements for conflict resolution that are reusable across different data types. Ensure the UI is accessible and provides clear instructions to users.

## 4. Create Conflict Presentation System [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Priority: medium
### Description: Develop a system to detect, aggregate, and present conflicts to users
### Details:
Implement a conflict detection service that identifies conflicts using the version tracking system. Create a conflict queue that aggregates conflicts for batch resolution. Build notification mechanisms to alert users about pending conflicts. Design a workflow that guides users through the conflict resolution process, showing appropriate UI components based on the conflict type.

## 5. Implement Resolution Preference Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a system to store and apply user preferences for conflict resolution
### Details:
Design a data structure to store conflict resolution preferences by entity type, field, or global settings. Implement a settings interface for users to configure their default resolution strategies. Create a preference application system that automatically applies saved preferences to new conflicts when appropriate. Include an option for users to update or reset their preferences.
