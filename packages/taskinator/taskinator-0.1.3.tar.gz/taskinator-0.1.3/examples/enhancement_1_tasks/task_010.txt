# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Sync Error Handling and Reporting
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5 (done), 7 (done)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust error handling for synchronization issues with clear user feedback.

# Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for all sync operations. Create user-friendly error messages. Add detailed logging for troubleshooting. Implement retry logic for transient errors. Create a system for reporting sync issues to users.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling with various failure scenarios. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed. Test retry logic with simulated transient failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Catching and Categorization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a comprehensive error catching system that categorizes sync errors by type
### Details:
Develop a centralized error handling service that catches and categorizes sync errors into types like network errors, authentication errors, data validation errors, and server errors. Implement try/catch blocks around all sync operations. Create error classes/types for different categories of errors. Ensure all sync functions properly propagate errors to the central handler.

## 2. Create User-Friendly Error Message System [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Develop a system to display appropriate user-friendly error messages based on error categories
### Details:
Design and implement UI components for displaying error messages (toasts, banners, modals). Create a mapping system that converts technical error details to user-friendly messages. Implement contextual help with suggested actions for each error type. Add the ability to collapse/expand technical details for advanced users. Ensure messages are clear and non-technical.

## 3. Implement Detailed Error Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a comprehensive logging system for sync errors to aid troubleshooting
### Details:
Implement a logging service that captures detailed information about sync errors including timestamps, user context, operation being performed, and full error stack traces. Add log levels (debug, info, warning, error). Create a mechanism to export logs for support purposes. Implement server-side logging for sync errors detected on the server. Ensure sensitive data is properly redacted from logs.

## 4. Develop Retry Logic for Transient Errors [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Priority: medium
### Description: Implement intelligent retry mechanisms for handling temporary sync failures
### Details:
Create a retry service that can automatically retry failed sync operations with exponential backoff. Implement logic to identify which errors are transient vs. permanent. Add user notifications about retry attempts. Develop a queue system for failed operations that can be retried when conditions improve (e.g., when network connectivity is restored). Implement maximum retry limits and fallback behaviors.
