# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Connection Status Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1 (done)
# Priority: low
# Description: Add continuous monitoring of NextCloud connection status with appropriate user feedback.

# Details:
Implement a system to monitor NextCloud connection status. Create visual indicators for connection state. Add automatic reconnection logic. Implement graceful degradation when NextCloud is unavailable. Add notifications for connection changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test connection monitoring with various network conditions. Verify reconnection logic works correctly. Test application behavior when NextCloud becomes unavailable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Connection Status Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a service that continuously monitors the connection status to NextCloud
### Details:
Develop a ConnectionStatusService that polls the NextCloud server at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds) to check connectivity. Implement different status states (CONNECTED, CONNECTING, DISCONNECTED, ERROR) and methods to query the current state. Use a health endpoint from NextCloud API for status checks. Handle timeouts and various error scenarios appropriately. Implement an event emitter to notify subscribers of connection status changes.

## 2. Create Visual Indicators for Connection State [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Implement UI components to display the current connection status to users
### Details:
Design and implement a ConnectionStatusIndicator component that visually represents the different connection states with appropriate colors and icons (green for connected, yellow for connecting, red for disconnected, etc.). Add this indicator to the application header or status bar. Create toast notifications for connection state changes. Include a detailed connection status page or modal that shows more information about the connection when users click on the indicator. Ensure indicators are accessible and provide clear text descriptions of status.

## 3. Implement Automatic Reconnection Logic and Graceful Degradation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Priority: medium
### Description: Add functionality to automatically reconnect to NextCloud and provide offline capabilities when disconnected
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff algorithm for reconnection attempts when connection is lost. Create a local storage cache for critical data that can be accessed when offline. Develop a queue system for operations performed while offline to be synchronized when connection is restored. Add user controls to manually trigger reconnection attempts. Implement feature detection to disable NextCloud-dependent features when offline, showing appropriate messaging. Create a synchronization process to reconcile local changes with server state upon reconnection.
