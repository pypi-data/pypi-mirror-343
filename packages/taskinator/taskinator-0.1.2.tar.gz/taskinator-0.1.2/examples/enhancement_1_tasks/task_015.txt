# Task ID: 15
# Title: Conduct Performance Optimization
# Status: blocked
# Dependencies: 5 (done), 8 (done), 11 (pending)
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize the synchronization process to minimize performance impact on regular operations.

# Details:
Profile and optimize sync operations to reduce CPU and memory usage. Implement batching and throttling to control resource usage. Add performance metrics collection. Optimize database queries related to sync. Ensure sync impact is less than 5% on regular operations.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing with various task loads. Measure and compare performance before and after optimization. Test on different hardware configurations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profiling and Bottleneck Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Analyze the current synchronization process to identify performance bottlenecks and resource consumption patterns
### Details:
Use performance profiling tools to measure CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O operations, and network traffic during sync operations. Create baseline metrics for comparison. Identify specific code paths, queries, and operations that consume disproportionate resources. Document findings with specific metrics and create a prioritized list of optimization targets.

## 2. Implement Batching and Throttling Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Design and implement mechanisms to control resource usage during synchronization
### Details:
Implement data batching to process records in configurable chunk sizes (start with 100-500 records per batch). Add throttling logic to limit sync operations to a maximum rate (e.g., N operations per minute). Implement backoff mechanisms for retry logic. Add configuration options to tune these parameters. Ensure these mechanisms can be adjusted dynamically without restarting the application.

## 3. Optimize Database Queries for Sync Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Refactor database queries used during synchronization to improve efficiency
### Details:
Review and optimize all SQL queries used in sync operations. Add appropriate indexes to support sync queries. Implement query pagination where appropriate. Consider denormalization or materialized views for frequently accessed sync data. Use database explain plans to verify query performance. Ensure all queries use prepared statements and parameter binding. Implement connection pooling if not already present.

## 4. Implement Performance Metrics Collection and Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3
### Priority: medium
### Description: Add instrumentation to collect, store, and analyze performance metrics for ongoing optimization
### Details:
Implement metrics collection for key performance indicators (sync duration, resource usage, etc.). Create a dashboard to visualize performance metrics over time. Set up alerting for performance degradation. Implement A/B testing capability to compare optimization strategies. Automate performance test runs to detect regressions. Document the performance impact of each optimization and verify the overall impact is less than 5% on regular operations.
