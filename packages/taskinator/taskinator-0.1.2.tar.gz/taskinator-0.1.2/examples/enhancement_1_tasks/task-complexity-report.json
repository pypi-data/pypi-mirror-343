      "taskTitle": "Develop Task Field Mapping System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the field mapping system into: 1) Core bidirectional mapping engine, 2) Special case handlers for rich text, priorities, and dates, 3) Task relationship and project mapping implementation, 4) Configuration system for extensibility",
      "reasoning": "Creating a flexible mapping system between two different data models is complex due to the need to handle various field types and special cases. The system must translate between different representations of task data, handle rich text conversion, map priorities, and deal with structural differences like task relationships. The requirement for configurability and extensibility further increases complexity."
