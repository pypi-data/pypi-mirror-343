# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Background Synchronization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5 (done)
# Priority: low
# Description: Add support for background synchronization to minimize user wait times.

# Details:
Create an asynchronous background sync process that can run without blocking the main application. Implement a job queue for sync operations. Add status reporting for background tasks. Ensure proper cleanup and error handling for background processes.

# Test Strategy:
Test background sync with various conditions. Verify that the application remains responsive during sync. Test error handling and recovery in background processes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Asynchronous Process Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a system to manage background processes that can run independently of the main application thread
### Details:
Design and implement a BackgroundProcessManager class that can spawn and manage worker threads or processes. Include functionality to start, pause, resume, and terminate background tasks. Implement a mechanism for the main application to communicate with background processes without blocking. Use appropriate threading or process isolation depending on the platform requirements.

## 2. Develop Job Queue System for Sync Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a queue system to manage and prioritize synchronization tasks
### Details:
Implement a SyncJobQueue class that can store, prioritize, and dispatch sync operations. Include methods for adding jobs with different priorities, canceling jobs, and checking job status. Implement persistence for the queue to survive application restarts. Design the queue to work with the BackgroundProcessManager to execute jobs asynchronously. Include mechanisms for handling dependencies between jobs.

## 3. Create Status Reporting Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Priority: medium
### Description: Implement a system to report the status of background synchronization tasks to the user interface
### Details:
Design and implement a SyncStatusReporter class that tracks and reports the progress of background sync operations. Create methods for background processes to update their status (percentage complete, current operation, etc.). Implement an observer pattern or event system so the UI can subscribe to status updates. Add support for aggregating status from multiple concurrent background tasks into a unified view. Include appropriate throttling to prevent UI performance issues.

## 4. Implement Error Handling and Cleanup for Background Processes [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Priority: medium
### Description: Develop robust error handling and resource cleanup for background synchronization
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for background processes, including retry logic for transient failures. Create a cleanup system to ensure resources are properly released when background tasks complete or fail. Implement logging of background process activities and errors for debugging. Add mechanisms to recover from unexpected termination of background processes. Create unit tests to verify error handling and cleanup functionality works correctly under various failure scenarios.
