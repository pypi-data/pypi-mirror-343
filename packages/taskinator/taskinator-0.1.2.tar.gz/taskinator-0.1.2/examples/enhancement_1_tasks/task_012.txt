# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Plugin Architecture for Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1 (done), 2 (done), 5 (done)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a plugin-based approach for the NextCloud integration.

# Details:
Create a plugin architecture that allows the NextCloud integration to be loaded as a module. Design clean interfaces between core Taskinator and the integration. Ensure the system can be extended to support other task systems in the future. Implement proper lifecycle management for the plugin.

# Test Strategy:
Test plugin loading and unloading. Verify that Taskinator works correctly with and without the plugin. Test plugin interfaces with mock implementations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Plugin Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create the core interfaces and abstract classes that will define how plugins interact with Taskinator
### Details:
Define a `PluginInterface` with methods like `initialize()`, `shutdown()`, `getMetadata()`, etc. Create a `TaskSourcePlugin` interface that extends the base plugin interface with methods specific to task sources like NextCloud. Include versioning support and capability declaration in the interface. Document the contract between the core application and plugins clearly.

## 2. Implement Plugin Loader and Lifecycle Manager [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a system to discover, load, initialize, and manage the lifecycle of plugins
### Details:
Develop a `PluginManager` class responsible for scanning plugin directories, loading plugin JARs dynamically, initializing plugins in the correct order based on dependencies, and managing their lifecycle. Implement proper error handling for plugin loading failures. Add support for plugin enabling/disabling at runtime. Include logging of plugin lifecycle events.

## 3. Define Integration Points in Core Application [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Identify and implement all the points in the core application where plugins can hook into the system
### Details:
Refactor the task management system to use a provider pattern that plugins can implement. Create event systems that plugins can subscribe to (task created, updated, etc.). Implement service locator or dependency injection system so plugins can access core services. Add extension points for UI components that plugins might want to add.

## 4. Create NextCloud Plugin Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3
### Priority: medium
### Description: Implement the NextCloud integration as the first plugin using the new architecture
### Details:
Move existing NextCloud integration code into a plugin structure. Implement all required interfaces. Create plugin manifest file with metadata. Add configuration UI that will be displayed in the plugins section. Ensure proper resource cleanup on plugin shutdown. Test the plugin's loading, initialization, and functionality.

## 5. Implement Plugin Dependency Management [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create a system to handle dependencies between plugins and with the core application
### Details:
Design a manifest format that allows plugins to declare dependencies on specific versions of the core API or other plugins. Implement version compatibility checking during plugin loading. Create a dependency resolution algorithm to determine correct loading order. Add conflict detection for incompatible plugins. Implement graceful fallback behavior when dependencies cannot be satisfied.
