# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create Quality Verification Process
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4 (blocked), 5 (pending), 8 (pending), 12 (pending)
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a formal process for verifying that all quality criteria are met.
# Details: 4. Establish verification roles and responsibilities
5. Define remediation process for failed verifications
6. Document the verification process
# Test Strategy:
Conduct a trial verification on a sample component to validate the process. Refine based on feedback and lessons learned.
# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Quality Criteria and Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the entire verification process with practical examples and remediation procedures.
### Details:
Compile all elements into a cohesive Quality Verification Process document. Include the remediation process for failed verifications with clear steps to follow when quality criteria aren't met. Provide real-world examples of verification scenarios, completed checklists, and reports. Create a training presentation to introduce the process to the team. Establish a review cycle to keep the verification process updated based on feedback and changing requirements.


## 2. Create Verification Procedures and Checklists [pending]
### Dependencies: 1
### Priority: medium
### Description: Develop standardized verification procedures and detailed checklists for different quality aspects.
### Details:
For each quality criterion defined in subtask 1, create step-by-step verification procedures. Develop specialized checklists for different verification activities (code review, testing, documentation review, etc.). Include test cases, expected results, and pass/fail conditions. Create the verification report template that captures all verification results, issues found, and recommendations. Use standardized formats that can be consistently applied across teams.


## 3. Establish Verification Roles and Responsibilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 1, 2
### Priority: medium
### Description: Define who is responsible for each aspect of the verification process, including escalation paths.
### Details:
Create a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for the verification process. Define specific roles such as Quality Assurance Lead, Verifiers, Approvers, and Stakeholders. Establish clear escalation paths for different scenarios (critical issues, disputed results, etc.). Define the timing and frequency of verification activities in the development lifecycle. Create templates for communication during the verification process.


## 4. Document Complete Verification Process with Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
### Priority: medium
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the entire verification process with practical examples and remediation procedures.
### Details:
Compile all elements into a cohesive Quality Verification Process document. Include the remediation process for failed verifications with clear steps to follow when quality criteria aren't met. Provide real-world examples of verification scenarios, completed checklists, and reports. Create a training presentation to introduce the process to the team. Establish a review cycle to keep the verification process updated based on feedback and changing requirements.
