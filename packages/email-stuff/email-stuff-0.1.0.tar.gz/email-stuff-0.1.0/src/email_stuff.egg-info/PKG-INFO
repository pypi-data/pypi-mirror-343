A package that allows to send emails via a number of different methods from within a python application. Adopted from ioe-email-stuff v0.0.13.

Run the following to install:

```python
python -m pip install email-stuff
```

## Usage

```python
from email_stuff import send_email

# Send an email - outlook only (for now).
# CC, BCC, attachment and server args not required.
# recipients, cc's and bcc's should be seperated by a semicolon, all in one string.
send_email("SUBJECT", "BODY", "USERNAME", "PASSWORD", "RECIPIENTS", cc="CCs", bcc="BCCs", sent_from="SENDER_ADDRESS", files=["./ATTACHMENT1.png"], server="smtp.outlook.com")

except Exception as e:

    print(e)
