The cancer cell lines are well characterized by multiomics screening in CCLE and DepMap, enabling the application of AI and machine learning techniques to study the association between drug sensitivity and the underlying molecular profiles. The large scale and variety of data modalities enabled us to build an interpretable deep learning framework, INSIGHT, integrating the multiomics data and the drug's molecular structure to predict drug response. We trained our model on the PRISM screen for single treatments and on the DrugComb screen database for combination treatments. Our method enables the in-silico extension of current screens by predicting drug response in cancer cell lines not included in the screen, as well as the drug response to novel single agent or combination therapy by leveraging the drug's molecular structure. Furthermore, the deep learning framework was built to enable biological interpretation. The connections between the hidden layers of the neural network incorporate prior biological knowledge such as signaling pathways. This enables the model, in addition to predicting the drug sensitivity profiles, to prioritize the pathways predictive of drug response and identify pathways related to the mechanism of action (MOA) and potential off target effects of novel drugs. The evaluation of our model using cross-validation on the PRISM and DrugComb dataset showed an improved performance compared to previously developed biologically informed deep learning methods and traditional state of the art machine learning methods like elastic-net and XGBoost. We illustrated with examples the value of incorporating biological knowledge into INSIGHT by relating the pathway activity of the predictive models to the MOA.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.21.649855v1?rss=1

Conventional microfluidic-based single-cell RNA sequencing platforms rely heavily on barcoded beads and intricate co-encapsulation schemes, often constrained by double Poisson limitations and the complexities of bead synthesis. In contrast, SIMIT-seq eliminates the need for beads entirely by employing a deterministic, orthogonal barcoding strategy within a two-dimensional micro-well array. This platform achieves an impressive single-cell indexing rate of 96.6% without the need for complex microfluidic operations. Here, we describe the design and fabrication of the SIMIT-seq platform, outline its workflow for transcript capture and library preparation, and demonstrate its application in profiling K562 cells.

This process requires metagenomic binning, which involves clustering assembled contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). However, existing computational binning methods often fail to leverage contigs' sequence context effectively. Most of them cannot incorporate taxonomic knowledge from external databases, and insufficient training data frequently limits the deep learning-based binning methods. To address these challenges, we propose CompleteBin, an innovative pretrained deep language model enhanced by dynamic contrastive learning. CompleteBin trains a pretrained deep language model using both long and short contigs and clusters the contigs based on their embeddings generated by the language model. This approach uniquely integrates the sequence context of contigs, incorporates taxonomic knowledge from external databases, and leverages unlimited data during training to significantly improve binning accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art binning tools such as CONCOCT, MetaBAT2, SemiBin2, and COMEBin, CompleteBin achieves higher performance across both simulated datasets (CAMI I and II) and diverse real-world datasets, including ocean, plant, freshwater, and human fecal samples. On average, CompleteBin achieves a 39.7% improvement on simulated datasets and a 58.9% improvement on real-world datasets in terms of the number of near-complete MAGs when compared to the best-performing results of other binning methods. These results highlight CompleteBin's robust capability to recover high-quality MAGs from long and short contigs, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing metagenomic research.

An alternate alphabet encoding richer features has the potential to improve search accuracy while leaving the underlying search algorithm unchanged. We design a ""3Dn"" structural alphabet that encodes the local neighborhoods around each amino acid in an interpretable way.

Existing models often rely on limited data types, such as sequence-based features or protein-protein interactions (PPIs), failing to capture the complex molecular relationships in biological systems. To address this, we developed ProtHGT, a heterogeneous graph transformer-based model that integrates diverse biological datasets into a unified framework using knowledge graphs for accurate and interpretable protein function prediction. Results: ProtHGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform current graph-based and sequence-based approaches.

Although chemists have recently developed a few transition metal-catalyzed methods, mimicking these enzymes to interconvert amine groups in acyclic substrates via transamination metathesis of a single C(sp2)-N bond, transamination of cyclic tertiary amines has remained a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we present the development of organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of two C(sp2)-N bonds in a cyclic substrate that allows for the challenging transformation to take place with up to 95% yield under exceptionally mild reaction conditions at room temperature without external catalysts and/or additives.

However, its accumulation patterns over development stages in FC-enriched tissue, biosynthetic pathways, and regulatory mechanisms in A. dahurica remain elusive. Here, we quantified the concentration dynamics of 17 coumarins across six developmental stages of root and found a gradual decrease in FC concentration as the roots develop. Using a de-novo assembled chromosome-level genome for A. dahurica, we conducted integrative multi-omics analyses to screen out candidate genes to fill in the sole missing step in the biosynthesis of imperatorin and isoimperatorin. This revealed that CYP71AZ18 catalyzes hydroxylation at the C-5 position of psoralen to generate bergaptol, while CYP71AZ19 and CYP83F95 catalyze hydroxylation at the C-8 position to produce xanthotoxol, notably indicating that a single step is catalyzed by two genes from distinct CYP450 subfamilies in this species. CYP71AZ19 originated from a proximal duplication event of CYP71AZ18, specific to A. dahurica, and subsequently underwent neofunctionalization.

The paucity of novel antibiotics in the clinical pipeline has exacerbated this issue, thereby warranting the development of new antibacterial therapies. The 'Trojan Horse' strategy entails conjugating antibiotics with bioactive components that not only facilitate the entry of antibiotic molecules into bacterial cells by circumventing the membrane barriers, but also augment the effects of conventional antibiotics against recalcitrant pathogens. These Trojan Horse elements can also serve as a promising tool for repurposing drugs with hitherto unexamined antimicrobial activity, or drugs with limited clinical utility due to considerable toxic side effects. In this review, we have discussed the current state of research on antibiotic conjugates with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the iron-chelating siderophores. The rationale and mechanisms of different antibiotic conjugates have been summarized, and the preclinical and clinical evidence pertaining to the activity of these conjugates against drug-resistant pathogens have been reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges associated with the clinical translation of these novel antimicrobials, and the future research directions have also been discussed. While antibiotic conjugates offer an attractive alternative to conventional antimicrobials, there are several obstacles to their clinical translation. A greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying AMR, and continuing advances in genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics will be crucial in designing more selective, potent, and safe antibiotic conjugates for tackling multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40268370/

Phages are an important component of the periodontal microbiome, yet our understanding of periodontal phages remains limited. Here, we investigated oral periodontal phages using various advanced bioinformatics tools based on genomes of key periodontitis pathogens. Prophages were found to encode various auxiliary genes that potentially enhance host survival and pathogenicity, including genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, antibiotic resistance, and immune modulation. We observed cross-species transmission among prophages with a complex network of phage-bacteria interactions. Our findings suggest that prophages play a crucial role in shaping the periodontal microbial ecosystem, influencing microbial community dynamics and the progression of periodontitis.IMPORTANCEIn the context of periodontitis, the ecological dynamics of the microbiome are largely driven by interactions between bacteria and their phages. While the impact of prophages on regulating oral pathogens has been increasingly recognized, their role in modulating periodontal disease remains underexplored. This study reveals that prophages within key periodontitis pathogens contribute significantly to virulence factor dissemination, antibiotic resistance, and host metabolism. By influencing the metabolic capabilities and survival strategies of their bacterial hosts, prophages may act as critical regulators of microbial communities in the oral cavity. Understanding these prophage-mediated interactions is essential not only for unraveling the mechanisms of periodontal disease progression but also for developing innovative therapeutic approaches that target the microbial ecosystem at the genetic level.

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed correlations between ICD activity and tumor immune dynamics. Bulk RNA sequencing categorized HCC into distinct molecular subtypes with varied immunological features. Machine learning-based prognostic models highlighted SCN5A's clinical relevance, supported by phenome-wide association studies connecting SCN5A to liver malignancies.

2025-04-24 20:04,Benchmarking foundation cell models for post-perturbation RNA-seq prediction.,"Gerold Csendes, Gema Sanz, Kristóf Z Szalay, Bence Szalai",PubMed,,"Accurately predicting cellular responses to perturbations is essential for understanding cell behaviour in both healthy and diseased states. While perturbation data is ideal for building such predictive models, its availability is considerably lower than baseline (non-perturbed) cellular data. To address this limitation, several foundation cell models have been developed using large-scale single-cell gene expression data. These models are fine-tuned after pre-training for specific tasks, such as predicting post-perturbation gene expression profiles, and are considered state-of-the-art for these problems. However, proper benchmarking of these models remains an unsolved challenge. In this study, we benchmarked two recently published foundation models, scGPT and scFoundation, against baseline models. Surprisingly, we found that even the simplest baseline model-taking the mean of training examples-outperformed scGPT and scFoundation. Furthermore, basic machine learning models that incorporate biologically meaningful features outperformed scGPT by a large margin. Additionally, we identified that the current Perturb-Seq benchmark datasets exhibit low perturbation-specific variance, making them suboptimal for evaluating such models. Our results highlight important limitations in current benchmarking approaches and provide insights into more effectively evaluating post-perturbation gene expression prediction models.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40269681/

2025-04-24 20:04,CDC6 as early biomarker for myocardial infarction with acute cellular senescence and repair mechanisms.,"Yun Wen, Xiaofang Zhang, Jiaxin Wang, Caixia Ma, Liangyan Wu, Lihong Wang",PubMed,,"We aimed to the exploration of genes related to the cell cycle and the mechanisms of cardiac cell repair and senescence post-MI. The sequencing dataset of myocardial infarction in mice (GSE161427) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, yielding 894 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGsup). Additionally, 494 senescence-related genes (SRGs) were obtained from the CellAge database. The overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEupSGs) between these two sets were identified using the R software. WGCNA using the GSE59867 dataset revealed a highly related module to MI. The intersection of core genes from the purple module and DEupSGs yielded 12 genes. Through machine learning and PPI analysis, two target genes related to MI and cellular senescence were identified: CDC6 and PLK1. ROC curve analysis using the MI animal myocardial sample dataset GSE775 and the patient blood sample dataset GSE60993 indicated that CDC6 expression has high diagnostic value for MI and cellular senescence, with differential expression levels at various times post-infarction.These results show that CDC6 is specifically upregulated in the early stages of MI, and both in vivo and ex vivo model results are consistent with bioinformatics findings. Additionally, overexpression of CDC6 in the early oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model in vitro increased the expression of genes mediating cardiac repair. Interestingly, when ABT263 was used to clear senescent cells, the expression of genes mediating repair in primary cardiac cells decreased, suggesting that acute ischemic hypoxia early on, CDC6-mediated acute cardiac cell senescence may promote early cardiac repair. This finding may provide new insights into the monitoring and assessment of cardiac cell senescence and repair in the early stages of MI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40269003/
2025-04-24 20:04,A hybrid variational autoencoder and WGAN with gradient penalty for tertiary protein structure generation.,"Aalaa I Sehsah, Afaf Mousa, Gamal Farouk",PubMed,,"Elucidating the tertiary structure of proteins is important for understanding their functions and interactions. While deep neural networks have advanced the prediction of a protein's native structure from its amino acid sequence, the focus on a single-structure view limits understanding of the dynamic nature of protein molecules. Acquiring a multi-structure view of protein molecules remains a broader challenge in computational structural biology. Alternative representations, such as distance matrices, offer a compact and effective way to explore and generate realistic tertiary protein structures. This paper presents TP-VWGAN, a hybrid model to improve the realism of generating distance matrix representations of tertiary protein structures. The model integrates the probabilistic representation learning of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with the realistic data generation strength of the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). The main modification of TP-VWGAN is incorporating residual blocks into its VAE architecture to improve its performance. The experimental results show that TP-VWGAN with and without residual blocks outperforms existing methods in generating realistic protein structures, but incorporating residual blocks enhances its ability to capture key structural features. Comparisons also demonstrate that the more accurately a model learns symmetry features in the generated distance matrices, the better it captures key structural features, as demonstrated through benchmarking against existing methods. This work moves us closer to more advanced deep generative models that can explore a broader range of protein structures and be applied to drug design and protein engineering.

Methods: We explored SAH-IA links using machine learning and bioinformatics, identifying 66 IA-related SAH genes. KEGG analysis highlighted pathways like NF-κB, TNF, and COVID-19. Results: Two immune-related genes (ZNF281, LRRN3) were identified, and a ceRNA network was constructed. Ten potential SAH-IA drugs were screened via CMAP.

2025-04-24 20:04,The Signed Two-Space Proximity Model for Learning Representations in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks. ,"Nakis N, Kosma C, Brativnyk A, Chatzianastasis M, Evdaimon I, Vazirgiannis M.",MED,,"Accurately predicting complex protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for decoding biological processes, from cellular functioning to disease mechanisms. However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles. S2-SPM's superior performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.

Longitudinally measuring and forecasting changes in DNA methylation can reveal patterns of ageing and disease progression, but biosamples may not always be available. We introduce a probabilistic machine learning framework based on multi-mean Gaussian processes, accounting for individual and gene correlations across time to forecast the methylation status of an individual into the future. Predicted methylation values were used to compute future epigenetic age and compared to chronological age. We show that this method can simultaneously predict methylation status at multiple genomic sites in children (age 5-7) using methylation data from earlier ages (0-4). Less than 10% difference between observed and predicted methylation values is found in approximately 95% of methylation sites. We show that predicted methylation profiles can be used to estimate other molecular phenotypes, such as epigenetic age, at any timepoint and enable association tests with health outcomes measured at the same timepoint. Limited longitudinal profiling of DNA methylation coupled with machine learning enables forecasting of epigenetic ageing and future health outcomes.

This study aims to identify a robust NEPC classifier and provide new perspectives for resolving intra- tumoral heterogeneity. Multi-omics analysis included 19 bulk transcriptomics, 14 single-cell transcriptomics, 1 spatial transcriptomics, 16 published NE signatures and 10 cellular experiments combined with multiple machine learning algorithms to construct a novel NEPC classifier and classification. A comprehensive single-cell atlas of prostate cancer was created from 70 samples, comprising 196,309 cells, among which 9% were identified as NE cells. Within this framework and in combination with bulk transcriptomics, a total of 100 high-quality NE-specific feature genes were identified and differentiated into NEPup sig and NEPdown sig. The random forest (RF) algorithm proved to be the most effective classifier for NEPC, leading to the establishment of the NEP100 model, which demonstrated robust validation across various datasets. In clinical settings, the use of the NEP100 model can greatly improve the diagnostic and prognostic prediction of NEPC. Hierarchical clustering based on NEP100 revealed four distinct NEPC subtypes, designated VR_O, Prol_N, Prol_P, and EMT_Y, each of which presented unique biological characteristics. This allows us to select different targeted therapeutic strategies for different subtypes of phenotypic pathways. Notably, NEP100 expression correlated positively with neuroendocrine differentiation and disease progression, while the VR-NE phenotype dominated by VR_O cells indicated a propensity for treatment resistance. Furthermore, AMIGO2, a component of the NEP100 signature, was associated with chemotherapy resistance and a poor prognosis, indicating that it is a pivotal target for future therapeutic strategies. This study used multi-omics analysis combined with machine learning to construct a novel NEPC classifier and classification system. NEP100 provides a clinically actionable framework for NEPC diagnosis and subtyping.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40263498/

However, such enzymes have caveats such as an increased risk of off-target editing<sup>3,5,6</sup>. To enable scalable reprogramming of Cas9 enzymes, here we combined high-throughput protein engineering with machine learning (ML) to derive bespoke editors more uniquely suited to specific targets. Via structure/function-informed saturation mutagenesis and bacterial selections, we obtained nearly 1,000 engineered SpCas9 enzymes and characterized their protospacer-adjacent motif<sup>7</sup> (PAM) requirements to train a neural network that relates amino acid sequence to PAM specificity. By utilizing the resulting PAM ML algorithm (PAMmla) to predict the PAMs of 64 million SpCas9 enzymes, we identified efficacious and specific enzymes that outperform evolution-based and engineered SpCas9 enzymes as nucleases and base editors in human cells while reducing off-targets. An in silico directed evolution method enables user-directed Cas9 enzyme design, including for allele-selective targeting of the RHO P23H allele in human cells and mice. Together, PAMmla integrates ML and protein engineering to curate a catalog of SpCas9 enzymes with distinct PAM requirements, and motivates the use of efficient and safe bespoke Cas9 enzymes instead of generalist enzymes for various applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40262634/

Recent advances in gene manipulation, automated behavioral acquisition at scale, and machine learning enable us to causally link behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms. Moreover, in some animals, such as the Drosophila melanogaster larva, this mapping is possible at the unprecedented scale of single neurons, allowing us to identify the neural microcircuits generating particular behaviors. These high-throughput screening efforts, linking the activation or suppression of specific neurons to behavioral patterns in millions of animals, provide a rich dataset to explore the diversity of nervous system responses to the same stimuli. However, important challenges remain in identifying subtle behaviors, including immediate and delayed responses to neural activation or suppression, and understanding these behaviors on a large scale. We here introduce several statistically robust methods for analyzing behavioral data in response to these challenges: 1) A generative physical model that regularizes the inference of larval shapes across the entire dataset. 2) An unsupervised kernel-based method for statistical testing in learned behavioral spaces aimed at detecting subtle deviations in behavior. 3) A generative model for larval behavioral sequences, providing a benchmark for identifying higher-order behavioral changes. 4) A comprehensive analysis technique using suffix trees to categorize genetic lines into clusters based on common action sequences.

Still, there are limited numbers of studies using clustering techniques to analyse the recent Global Dietary Database. This study aims to extend an existing multivariate time-series clustering algorithm to allow for greater customisability and to provide the first cluster analysis of the Global Dietary Database to explore temporal trends in country-level nutrition profiles (1990-2018).<h4>Design</h4>Trends in sugar-sweetened beverage intake and nutritional deficiency were explored using the newly developed program 'MTSclust'. Time-series clustering algorithms are different from simple clustering approaches in their ability to appreciate temporal elements.<h4>Setting</h4>Nutritional and demographical data from 176 countries were analysed from the Global Dietary Database.<h4>Participants</h4>Population representative samples of the 176 in the Global Dietary Database.<h4>Results</h4>In a 3-class test specific to the domain, the MTSclust program achieved a mean accuracy of 71.5% (Adjusted Rand Index [ARI]=0.381) while the mean accuracy of a popular algorithm, DTWclust, was 58% (ARI=0.224). The clustering of nutritional deficiency and sugar-sweetened beverage intake identified several common trends among countries and found that these did not change by demographics. Multivariate time-series clustering demonstrated a global convergence towards a Western diet.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While global nutrition trends are associated with geography, demographic variables such as sex and age, are less influential to the trends of certain nutrition intake. The literature could be further supplemented by applying outcome-guided methods to explore how these trends link to disease burdens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40257123/
