Current SL prediction models heavily rely on extensive labeled data for specific cell lines to accurately identify SL pairs. However, a major limitation is the scarcity of SL labels across most cell lines, which makes it challenging to predict SL pairs for target cell lines with limited or even no available labels in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, gene interactions could be opposite between training and test cell lines, i.e. SL vs. non-SL, which further aggravates the challenge of generalization among cell lines. A promising strategy is to transfer knowledge learned from cell lines with relatively abundant SL labels to those with limited SL labels for the discovery of novel SL pairs, i.e., cell line-adapted SL prediction. Here, we propose MiT4SL, a multi-omics triplet representation learning model for cell line-adapted SL prediction. The core idea of MiT4SL is to model cell lineage information as embeddings, which are generated by combining a protein-protein interaction network representation tailored to each cell line with the corresponding protein sequence embeddings. We then combine these cell line embeddings with gene pair representations derived from a biomedical knowledge graph and protein sequences. This triplet representation learning strategy enables MiT4SL to capture both shared biological mechanisms across cell lines and those unique to each cell line, effectively mitigating distribution shift and improving generalization to target cell lines. Additionally, explicit cell line embeddings provide the necessary signals for MiT4SL to effectively differentiate between cell line contexts, enabling it to adjust predictions and mitigate possible label conflicts for the same gene pair across different cell lines. Experimental results across various cell line-adapted scenarios show that MiT4SL outperforms six state-of-the-art models. To the best of our knowledge, MiT4SL is the first deep learning model designed specifically for cancer cell line-adapted SL prediction.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.20.649694v1?rss=1

In recent years, long-read sequencing has improved pangenome construction for key eukaryotic species, addressing this issue to some extent. Sufficient-coverage high-fidelity (HiFi) data for population genomics is often prohibitively expensive, limiting its use in large-scale populations and broader eukaryotic species and creating an urgent need for robust ultra-low coverage assemblies. However, current assemblers underperform in such conditions. To address this, we propose HiFiCCL, the first assembly framework specifically designed for ultra-low-coverage high-fidelity reads, using a reference-guided, chromosome-by-chromosome assembly approach. We demonstrate that HiFiCCL improves ultra-low-coverage assembly performance of existing assemblers and outperforms the state-of-the-art assemblers on human and plant datasets. Tested on 45 human datasets (~5x coverage), HiFiCCL combined with hifiasm reduces the length of misassembled contigs relative to hifiasm by an average of 21.19% and up to 38.58%. These improved assemblies enhance germline structural variant detection, reduce chromosome-level mis-scaffolding, enable more accurate pangenome graph construction, and improve the detection of rare and somatic structural variants based on the pangenome graph under ultra-low-coverage conditions.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.20.649739v1?rss=1

As these processes yield trans-bilayer imbalances in lipid numbers, cells must actively flip lipid molecules across the bilayer to enable growth. Using giant and small unilamellar vesicles (GUVs and SUVs, respectively), we here recapitulate cellular growth and division under various conditions of transmembrane flip flop of lipids. By dynamically monitoring the changes in reduced volume and spontaneous curvature of GUVs that grow by fusion of many small SUVs, the morphology of these growing synthetic cells is quantified. We demonstrate that lipid flip flop relaxes curvature stresses and yields more symmetrically sized buds. Further increasing the neck curvature is shown to lead to bud scission.

Their versatility can enable applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and metabolic engineering. This study presents a novel ""semi-trans"" aptazyme-based system for gene regulation in bacteria, expanding the range of GENAs.

While existing methods rely on statistical models, motif enrichment, or prior-based inference, they often suffer from deterministic assumptions about regulatory relationships, reliance on static regulatory databases, or lack of interpretability. Moreover, few approaches can effectively integrate prior biological knowledge with data-driven inference to capture novel, dynamic, and context-specific regulatory interactions. <h4>Results</h4> To address these limitations, we develop scRegulate, a generative deep learning framework that leverages variational inference to infer TF activities while incorporating gene regulatory network (GRN) priors. By integrating structured biological constraints with a probabilistic latent space model, scRegulate offers a scalable and biologically interpretable solution for prediction of regulatory interactions from scRNA-seq data. We comprehensively benchmark scRegulate using multiple public experimental and synthetic datasets generated from GRouNdGAN to demonstrate its ability to infer TF activities and GRNs that are consistent with the underlying ground-truth regulatory interactions. scRegulate outperforms existing TF inference methods, achieving AUROC values of 0.71-0.86 and AUPRC values of 0.80-0.95 on three synthetic datasets. Additionally, scRegulate accurately recapitulates experimentally validated TF knockdown effects on a Perturb-seq dataset, achieving a mean log2 fold change of - 0.66 to -16.98 (p ≤ 8.06×10 −13 ) for key TFs such as ELK1, EGR1, and CREB1. Applied to the PBMC scRNA-seq data, scRegulate reconstructs cell-type-specific GRNs and identifies differentially active TFs that align with known immune regulatory pathways.

To investigate gene expression differences between cells in the context of an embryo with those that have been freed from instructive signals and acquired novel lived experiences, we compare transcriptomes of these basal Xenobots with age-matched Xenopus embryos. Basal Xenobots show significantly larger inter-individual gene variability than age-matched embryos, suggesting increased exploration of the transcriptional space. We identify at least 537 (non-epidermal) transcripts uniquely upregulated in these Xenobots. Phylostratigraphy shows a majority of transcriptomic shifts in the basal Xenobots towards evolutionarily ancient transcripts. Pathway analyses indicate transcriptomic shifts in the categories of motility machinery, multicellularity, stress and immune response, metabolism, thanatotranscriptome, and sensory perception of sound and mechanical stimuli. We experimentally confirm that basal Xenobots respond to acoustic stimuli via changes in behavior. Together, these data may have implications for evolution, biomedicine, and synthetic morphoengineering.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40263484/

This data imbalance can lead to biased ML or deep learning (DL) models, which fail to accurately predict the underrepresented classes, thus limiting the robustness and applicability of these models. With the rapid advancement of ML and DL algorithms, several promising solutions to this issue have emerged, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of current methodologies. In this review, we examine the prominent ML approaches used to tackle the imbalanced data challenge in different areas of chemistry, including resampling techniques, data augmentation techniques, algorithmic approaches, and feature engineering strategies. Each of these methods is evaluated in the context of its application across various aspects of chemistry, such as drug discovery, materials science, cheminformatics, and catalysis. We also explore future directions for overcoming the imbalanced data challenge and emphasize data augmentation <i>via</i> physical models, large language models (LLMs), and advanced mathematics. The benefit of balanced data in new material design and production and the persistent challenges are discussed. Overall, this review aims to elucidate the prevalent ML techniques applied to mitigate the impacts of imbalanced data within the field of chemistry and offer insights into future directions for research and application.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40271022/

However, engineering these systems is challenging, requiring precise control over the cell concentrations of distinct members and coordination of their activity. Here, we develop a bacterial consortia-based biosensor for Heme and Lactate, wherein members are coupled through a global shared quorum-sensing signal that simultaneously controls the activity of the diverse biosensing strains. The multicellular system incorporates a gene circuit that computes the minimum between each biosensor's activity and the shared signal. We evaluate three consortia configurations: one where the shared signal is externally supplied, another directly produced via an inducible gene circuit, and a third generated through an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) gene circuit. Among these configurations, the IFFL system, which maintains the shared signal at low and stable levels over an extended period, demonstrates improved performance and robustness against perturbations in cell populations. Finally, we examine these coupled consortia to monitor Lactate and Heme in humanized fecal samples for diagnostics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40263365/

However, current methods often rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for enrichment of marker genes. PCR can introduce significant biases that affect quantification and is typically restricted to one target loci at a time, limiting the diversity that can be captured in a single reaction. Here, we address these issues by using Cas9 to enrich marker genes for long-read nanopore sequencing directly from a DNA sample, removing the need for PCR. We show that this approach can effectively isolate a 4.5 kb region covering partial 18S and 28S rRNA genes and the ITS region in a mixed nematode community, and further adapt our approach for characterizing a diverse microbial community. We demonstrate the ability for Cas9-based enrichment to support multiplexed targeting of several different DNA regions simultaneously, enabling optimal marker gene selection for different clades of interest within a sample. We also find a strong correlation between input DNA concentrations and output read proportions for mixed-species samples, demonstrating the ability for quantification of relative species abundance.

Here, we found profound genomic instability in PCa cells with SPOP gene mutations and confirmed the sensitivity of SPOP-mutated PCa cells to olaparib-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we identified olaparib-induced CK2-mediated phosphorylation of PIAS1-S468, which in turn mediated SUMOylation of SPOP, thus promoting its E3 ligase activity in the DDR. Moreover, an abnormal CK2/PIAS1/SPOP axis due to SPOP mutations or defects in CK2-mediated phosphorylation of PIAS1, as well as SPOP inhibitor treatment, led to impaired DDR, thus increasing olaparib-induced apoptosis of PCa cells and enhancing olaparib sensitivity in animal models and patient-derived organoids.

This paper leverages the statistical analogies between text and transcriptomic datasets to compare different topic modeling methods when applied to gene expression data. Specifically, we test their accuracy in the specific task of discovering and reconstructing the tissue structure of the human transcriptome and distinguishing healthy from cancerous tissues. We examine the properties of the latent space recovered by different methods, highlight their differences, and their pros and cons across different tasks. We focus in particular on how different statistical priors can affect the results and their interpretability.

Almost all patients with synovial sarcoma (SS) carry a characteristic gene fusion, SS18::SSX, which produces a disease-specific oncoprotein that is incorporated into the switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes and profoundly alters their functionalities. Targeting epigenetic dependency in cancers holds promise for improving current treatment. Leveraging on cancer cell dependency dataset, pharmacological tools, and genomic profiling, we find WDR5, a factor critical for depositing histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, to be an unexplored vulnerability in SS. Mechanistically, WDR5 and SS18::SSX interact and colocalize at oncogenes where WDR5 promotes H3K4 methylation and the chromatin association of SS18::SSX-containing chromatin-remodeling complexes. WDR5 degradation by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) not only suppresses the SS18::SSX-related oncogenic programs but additionally causes the ribosomal protein deregulations leading to p53 activation.

However, existing approaches often face computational challenges or lack precision when dealing with long RNA sequences and/or pseudoknots. To address this, we propose a divide-and-conquer method based on deep learning, called DivideFold, for predicting the secondary structures including pseudoknots of long RNAs. Our approach is able to scale to long RNAs by recursively partitioning sequences into smaller fragments until they can be managed by an existing model able to predict RNA secondary structure including pseudoknots. We show that our approach exhibits superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for pseudoknot prediction and secondary structure prediction including pseudoknots for long RNAs.

However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles.<h4>Results</h4>S2-SPM's superior performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.<h4>Availability</h4>S2-SPM is implemented and freely available under MIT license at https://github.com/Nicknakis/S2SPM.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Available at https://github.com/Nicknakis/S2SPM/blob/main/suppl.pdf.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40266854/

While aging is a well-established risk factor, the underlying mechanisms distinguishing early- and late-onset ovarian cancer remain poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>This study analyzed the global burden and age-related trends of ovarian cancer using the GBD database. A cut-off age of 55 years was used to differentiate between early and late onset ovarian cancer, and a Mendelian randomization method was also used to investigate the causal relationship between aging and ovarian cancer. Machine learning was applied to identify tumor-specific age-associated genes, followed by bioinformatics analyses and single-cell sequencing to explore the roles of these genes and immune profile alterations in ovarian cancer. Additionally, models were constructed, and drug sensitivity analyses performed to evaluate their potential as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets.<h4>Results</h4>Ovarian cancer incidence and mortality exhibit age-related trends, with telomere length positively associated with increased risk (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01-1.60, P = 3.90 × 10⁻<sup>2</sup>). Older patients with OC have a worse prognosis. PRKCD and UCP2 were significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer. PRKCD facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to ovarian cancer progression, while UCP2 modulates ROS dynamics, influencing chemoresistance. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed differences between high- and low-expression groups, particularly in T cells, macrophages, and other immune cells. Both genes are sensitive to a varity of drugs, including dasatinib, fluvastatin, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Aging is a significant risk factor for ovarian cancer, with PRKCD and UCP2 closely linked to its onset and progression. These genes show promise as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40269926/
