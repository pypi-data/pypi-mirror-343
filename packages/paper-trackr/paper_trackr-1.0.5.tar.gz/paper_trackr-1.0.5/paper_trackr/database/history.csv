2025-04-23 18:19,GOALS: Gene Ontology Analysis with Layered Shells for Enhanced Functional Insight and Visualization,"Gene Ontologies (GOs) are standardized descriptions of gene functions in terms of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, capturing their Parent-Child relationships in a structured framework and advancing cancer biological modeling to provide consistent and meaningful insights into functional genomics analysis. The conventional GO hierarchical structure is defined by human curation experts, with levels determined by the shortest path to the root term. However, grouping GOs poses challenges due to the uneven distribution of gene members within GO terms and inconsistencies in the level of detail across terms at the same GO level. In this work, we introduce Gene Ontology Analysis using Layered Shells (GOALS), a novel tool that discretizes GOAs into optimal layers. GOALS creates scalable GO layers while maintaining a balanced number of genes across GOs in each layer. Unlike existing tools, the GOALS framework organizes GO terms using a bottom-up approach based on their co-membership network, discretizing GOs to achieve an exponential fit with GO's gene member size. Meanwhile, GOALS reveals clusters or supersets reflecting biological relevance by unsupervised clustering of GO's latent projections. In a case study on mouse natural killer (NK) cell development, GOALS identified distinct GO functional clusters with multi-GO layers to reveal multiple levels of detail from specific to abstract contexts to maximize signal discovery and uncover those signals' associations with trajectory divergence. More importantly, GOALS enhances enrichment analysis by introducing additional GO stratification and latent GO map that enables more accurate classification of functional differences. GOALS offers a robust and innovative framework for exploring disordered GO clusters, mining GO activities, and analyzing potential GO-GO interplays. By addressing critical challenges in functional genomics, GOALS provides a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of cell heterogeneity and potentially uncovering actionable insights for therapeutic development.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.650095v1?rss=1

2025-04-23 18:19,GAT-HiC: Efficient Reconstruction of 3D Chromosome Structure via Residual Graph Attention Neural Networks,"Hi-C is an experimental technique to measure the genome-wide topological dynamics and three-dimensional (3D) shape of chromosomes indirectly via counting the number of interactions between distinct sets of loci. One can estimate the 3D shape of a chromosome over these indirect interaction datasets. Here, we come up with graph attention and residual network-based GAT-HiC to predict three-dimensional chromosome structure from Hi-C interactions. GAT-HiC is distinct from the existing 3D chromosome shape prediction approaches in a way that it can generalize to data that is different than train data. So, we can train GAT-HiC on one type of Hi-C interaction matrix and infer on a completely dissimilar interaction matrix. GAT-HiC combines the unsupervised vertex embedding method Node2vec with an attention-based graph neural network when predicting each genomic locis three-dimensional coordinates from Hi-C interaction matrix. We test the performance of our method across multiple Hi-C interaction datasets, where a trained model can be generalized across distinct cell populations, distinct restriction enzymes, and distinct Hi-C resolutions over human and mouse. GAT-HiC can reconstruct accurately in all these scenarios. Our method outperforms the existing approaches in terms of the accuracy of three-dimensional chromosome shape inference over interaction datasets.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.18.649477v1?rss=1
2025-04-23 18:19,EpitopeTransfer: a Phylogeny-aware transfer learning framework for taxon-specific linear B-cell epitope prediction,"The identification of linear B-cell epitopes (LBCEs) plays a pivotal role in the development of immunological products such as immunodiagnostic, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. This criticality has led to the development of computational approaches for the prediction of LBCEs, aiming at accelerating discovery and prioritising targets for experimental assessment. Existing LBCE predictors rely on having access to large volumes of data from a wide range of pathogens for training predictive models, which can result in biases towards widely studied organisms and compromise performance when focusing on neglected or emerging pathogens. We introduce a phylogeny-aware transfer learning strategy that results in noticeable gains in expected predictive performance. This is achieved by fine tuning large protein language models using abundant data from higher-level taxa and applying this refined feature embedder for fitting pathogen- or lower taxon-specific models. We report substantially increased performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches for LBCE prediction, and show that these gains can be directly attributed to the use of phylogeny-aware fine tuning of the feature embedder coupled with pathogen- or taxon-optimized modelling.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.17.649425v1?rss=1

However, deciphering the molecular mechanisms that link mutations to phenotypic outcomes remains a significant challenge. Here, we present ProTiler-Mut, a versatile computational framework that harnesses tiling mutagenesis screens, which introduce variants across entire protein sequences, to facilitate investigation of mutation-to-phenotype associations at multiple levels, including individual residues, protein substructures, and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). As demonstrated through our analyses of base editing (BE) screens targeting DNA Damage Response (DDR) proteins and T cell regulators, ProTiler-Mut provides novel insights into the mutation-phenotype linkages, including: i) refined classification of mutation that reveals separation-of-function (SOF) category beyond the conventional binary classification of loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF); ii) definition of phenotype-associated hotspot substructures that enable the inference of the function of unscreened pathogenic mutations; and iii) identification of phenotype-associated PPIs disrupted by functional mutations. Through ProTiler-Mut analyses, we identified a substructure harboring pathogenic GOF mutations that disrupt interactions between the kinases MAPK1 and RSK1, leading to MAPK1 activation and elevated expression of the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of ProTiler-Mut to various mutagenesis screening platforms, highlighting its broad utility and generalizability.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.17.649336v1?rss=1
2025-04-23 18:19,Fine-Tuning Protein Language Models Unlocks the Potential of Underrepresented Viral Proteomes,"Protein language models (pLMs) have revolutionized computational biology by generating rich protein vector representations -- or embeddings -- enabling major advancements in de novo protein design, structure prediction, variant effect analysis, and evolutionary studies. Despite these breakthroughs, current pLMs often exhibit biases against proteins from underrepresented species, with viral proteins being particularly affected -- frequently referred to as the ""dark matter"" of the biological world due to their vast diversity and ubiquity, yet sparse representation in training datasets. Here, we show that fine-tuning pre-trained pLMs on viral protein sequences, using diverse learning frameworks and parameter-efficient strategies, significantly enhances representation quality and improves performance on downstream tasks. To support further research, we provide source code for fine-tuning pLMs and benchmarking embedding quality. By enabling more accurate modeling of viral proteins, our approach advances tools for understanding viral biology, combating emerging infectious diseases, and driving biotechnological innovation.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.17.649224v1?rss=1

However, panel size is limited in practice by unmixing-dependent spreading (UDS), a mathematical phenomenon which leads to a progressive deterioration of unmixed signal-to-noise ratios in panels that contain fluorochrome combinations with significant spectral overlap. Choosing spectrally compatible sets of fluorochromes that avoid UDS is a complex and labor-intensive task involving substantial trial-and-error experimentation. Here, we provide a detailed explanation of UDS and practical strategies for handling UDS in large spectral panels. We describe the empirical hallmarks of UDS, demonstrate how to quantify its impact, and dissect its underlying mathematical cause in terms of spectral collinearity. We present novel computational metrics that can be used to select optimal combinations of fluorochromes in a platform-agnostic fashion based on publicly available reference data, providing a general tool for spectral panel design.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.17.649396v1?rss=1

Despite its potential, the complexity of scRNA-seq data analysis often poses challenges for researchers without computational expertise. To address this, we developed scStudio, a user-friendly, comprehensive and modular web-based application designed to democratize scRNA-seq data analysis. scStudio is equipped with a suite of features designed to streamline data retrieval and analysis with both flexibility and ease, including automated dataset retrieval from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Users can also upload their own datasets in a variety of formats, integrate multiple datasets, and tailor their analyses using a wide range of flexible methods with options for parameter optimization. The application supports all the essential steps required for scRNA-seq data analysis, including in-depth quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression and functional enrichment analysis. scStudio also tracks the history of analyses, supports session data storage and export, and facilitates collaboration through data sharing features.

It was the first publicly available pipeline on Github to perform full analysis of WGS data for M. tuberculosis encompassing quality control through mapping, variant calling for lineage classification, drug resistance prediction, and phylogenetic inference. However, the pipeline's architecture is not optimal for high-performance computing or cloud computing environments, which often require large datasets. To optimize the pipeline, a Nextflow wrapper MTBseq-nf, was created which offers shorter execution times through the parallel mode along with multiple other thematic improvements. The MTBseq-nf wrapper, as opposed to the linear batched analysis of samples in TBfull step of MTBseq pipeline, can execute multiple instances of the same step in parallel and therefore makes full use of the provided computational resources. For evaluation of scalability and reproducibility, we used 90 M. tuberculosis genomes (ENA accession PRJEB7727) for the benchmarking analysis on a dedicated computing server. In our experiments the execution time of MTBseq-nf parallel analysis mode is at least twice as fast as the standard MTBseq pipeline for more than 20 samples. Furthermore, the MTBseq-nf wrapper facilitates reproducibility using the nf-core, bioconda, and biocontainers projects for platform independence. The proposed MTBseq-nf wrapper pipeline is a user-friendly pipeline optimized for hardware efficiency, scalability for larger datasets, and improved reproducibility.",,bioRxiv,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.17.649337v1?rss=1
2025-04-23 18:19,Benchmarking circRNA Detection Tools from Long-Read Sequencing Using Data-Driven and Flexible Simulation Framework,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are unique non-coding RNAs with covalently closed loop structures formed through backsplicing events. Their stability, tissue-specific expression patterns, and potential as disease biomarkers have garnered increasing attention. However, their circular structure and diverse size range pose challenges for conventional sequencing technologies. Long-read Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing offers promising capabilities for capturing entire circRNA molecules without fragmentation, yet the effectiveness of bioinformatic tools for analyzing this data remains understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive benchmark comparison of three specialized tools for circRNA detection from ONT long-read data: CIRI-long (Zhang et al., 2021), IsoCIRC (Xin et al., 2021), and circNICK-Irs (Rahimi et al., 2021). To address the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks, we developed a novel computational pipeline, open-source and freely available, to generate realistic simulated circRNA ONT long-read datasets. Our pipeline integrates several molecular features of circRNAs extracted from established databases and real datasets into NanoSim tool (Hafezqorani et al., 2020) and outputs FASTQ reads reflecting therefore biological diversity and technical properties. We systematically assessed tool performance across key metrics, including precision, recall, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score. Our analysis revealed distinct performance profiles: while all tools exhibited high specificity, they varied in precision and their ability to detect different circRNA subtypes, often showing limited sensitivity and precision. Notably, the overlap in detected circRNAs among tools was relatively low. Additionally, computational efficiency varied significantly across the tools. This suggests that relying on a single tool might not be ideal, and combining tools or improving algorithms could be necessary for more accurate circRNA detection from ONT data. This benchmark provides valuable insights for researchers selecting appropriate tools for circRNA studies using ONT sequencing.

However, current technology offers limited resolution and dimensionality, impeding our ability to resolve and interrogate spatiotemporally regulated networks of signaling activities. Here we introduce highly sensitive chemigenetic kinase activity biosensors that combine the genetically encodable self-labeling tag, HaloTag7, with far-red-emitting synthetic fluorophores. This technology enables both four-dimensional activity imaging and functional super-resolution imaging using stimulated emission depletion and other high-resolution microscopy techniques, permitting signaling activity to be detected across scales with the necessary resolution. Stimulated emission depletion imaging enabled the investigation of protein kinase A activity at individual clathrin-coated pits. We further demonstrate imaging of up to five analytes in single living cells, an increase in the dimensionality of biosensor multiplexing. Multiplexed imaging of cellular responses to the activation of different G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allowed quantitative measurements of spatiotemporal network states downstream of individual GPCR-ligand pairs.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258957/

Here, we report IgHuAb, a large language model for high-throughput generation of paired human antibody sequences. Using IgHuAb, we created SynAbLib, a synthetic human antibody library that mimics population-level features of naturally occurring human antibody sequences, yet is associated with significantly greater diversity in sequence space. Further, experimental validation of a diverse set of antibodies from SynAbLib showed robust expression yields. IgHuAb and SynAbLib provide a readily expandable platform for human monoclonal antibody generation that can be efficiently mined for antibody sequences with target properties.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258041/
2025-04-23 18:19,Unveiling the role of phages in shaping the periodontal microbial ecosystem.,"The oral microbiome comprises various species and plays a crucial role in maintaining the oral ecosystem and host health. Phages are an important component of the periodontal microbiome, yet our understanding of periodontal phages remains limited. Here, we investigated oral periodontal phages using various advanced bioinformatics tools based on genomes of key periodontitis pathogens. Prophages were found to encode various auxiliary genes that potentially enhance host survival and pathogenicity, including genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, antibiotic resistance, and immune modulation. We observed cross-species transmission among prophages with a complex network of phage-bacteria interactions. Our findings suggest that prophages play a crucial role in shaping the periodontal microbial ecosystem, influencing microbial community dynamics and the progression of periodontitis.IMPORTANCEIn the context of periodontitis, the ecological dynamics of the microbiome are largely driven by interactions between bacteria and their phages. While the impact of prophages on regulating oral pathogens has been increasingly recognized, their role in modulating periodontal disease remains underexplored. This study reveals that prophages within key periodontitis pathogens contribute significantly to virulence factor dissemination, antibiotic resistance, and host metabolism. By influencing the metabolic capabilities and survival strategies of their bacterial hosts, prophages may act as critical regulators of microbial communities in the oral cavity. Understanding these prophage-mediated interactions is essential not only for unraveling the mechanisms of periodontal disease progression but also for developing innovative therapeutic approaches that target the microbial ecosystem at the genetic level. These insights emphasize the need for more comprehensive studies on the ecological risks posed by prophages in shaping microbial pathogenicity and resistance.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40152610/

Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of traditional wet lab experiments, analyzing circRNA-miRNA associations is often inefficient and labor-intensive. Although some computational models have been developed to identify these associations, they fail to capture the deep collaborative features between circRNA and miRNA interactions and do not guide the training of feature extraction networks based on these high-order relationships, leading to poor prediction performance.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40264118/
2025-04-23 18:19,Multi-omics analysis constructs a novel neuroendocrine prostate cancer classifier and classification system.,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a subtype of prostate cancer (PCa) with poor prognosis and high heterogeneity, currently lacks accurate markers. This study aims to identify a robust NEPC classifier and provide new perspectives for resolving intra- tumoral heterogeneity. Multi-omics analysis included 19 bulk transcriptomics, 14 single-cell transcriptomics, 1 spatial transcriptomics, 16 published NE signatures and 10 cellular experiments combined with multiple machine learning algorithms to construct a novel NEPC classifier and classification. A comprehensive single-cell atlas of prostate cancer was created from 70 samples, comprising 196,309 cells, among which 9% were identified as NE cells. Within this framework and in combination with bulk transcriptomics, a total of 100 high-quality NE-specific feature genes were identified and differentiated into NEPup sig and NEPdown sig. The random forest (RF) algorithm proved to be the most effective classifier for NEPC, leading to the establishment of the NEP100 model, which demonstrated robust validation across various datasets. In clinical settings, the use of the NEP100 model can greatly improve the diagnostic and prognostic prediction of NEPC. Hierarchical clustering based on NEP100 revealed four distinct NEPC subtypes, designated VR_O, Prol_N, Prol_P, and EMT_Y, each of which presented unique biological characteristics. This allows us to select different targeted therapeutic strategies for different subtypes of phenotypic pathways. Notably, NEP100 expression correlated positively with neuroendocrine differentiation and disease progression, while the VR-NE phenotype dominated by VR_O cells indicated a propensity for treatment resistance. Furthermore, AMIGO2, a component of the NEP100 signature, was associated with chemotherapy resistance and a poor prognosis, indicating that it is a pivotal target for future therapeutic strategies. This study used multi-omics analysis combined with machine learning to construct a novel NEPC classifier and classification system.

We performed weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) using two microarray datasets (GSE139061 and GSE66494) in the GEO database and identified autophagy signatures by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and GSEA enrichment analysis. Machine learning algorithms such as LASSO, random forest, and XGBoost were used to construct the diagnostic model, and the diagnostic performance of GSE30718 (AKI) and GSE37171 (CKD) was used as validation cohorts to evaluate its diagnostic performance. The study identified 14 autophagy candidate genes, among which ATP6V1C1 and COPA were identified as key biomarkers that were able to effectively distinguish between AKI and CKD. Immune cell infiltration and GSEA analysis revealed immune dysregulation in AKI, and these genes were associated with inflammation and immune pathways. Single-cell analysis showed that ATP6V1C1 and COPA were specifically expressed in AKI and CKD, which may be related to renal fibrosis. In addition, drug prediction and molecular docking analysis proposed SZ(+)-(S)-202-791 and PDE4 inhibitor 16 as potential therapeutic agents. In summary, this study provides new insights into the relationship between AKI and CKD and lays a foundation for the development of new treatment strategies.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258914/

The underlying pathological mechanisms of TAAD requires further elucidation to develop effective prevention and pharmacological treatment strategies. Inflammation plays a crucial role in TAAD pathogenesis. Disulfidptosis, an emerging type of cell death, may shed light on disease mechanisms. This study investigates the role of disulfidptosis-related genes in immune infiltration in TAAD. TAAD gene expression datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Immune cell infiltration analysis assessed immune cell dysregulation in TAAD. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TAAD samples and controls were identified and intersected with known disulfidptosis-related gene sets to obtain relevant DEGs. Hub genes were identified using machine learning algorithms. A diagnostic model was constructed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression on 25 TAAD samples. Consensus clustering classified TAAD samples based on disulfidptosis-related gene expression. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, elucidated associated biological processes and pathways. A total of 13,316 DEGs were identified, among which 11 disulfidptosis-related genes were screened: INF2, CD2AP, PDLIM1, ACTN4, MYH10, MYH9, FLNA, FLNB, TLN1, MYL6, ACTB, CAPZB, DSTN, and IQGAP1. Most of these genes exhibited lower expression levels in TAAD samples, except CAPZB, and were correlated with immune cell infiltration. Cluster-specific DEGs were found in one cluster, involving several immune response processes. Co-clustering analysis based on disulfidptosis-related genes classified TAAD samples into two clusters, with higher gene expression levels observed in cluster C2 compared to cluster C1. Three key hub genes were identified, and potential therapeutic mechanisms for TAAD were explored. Immuno-infiltration results revealed significant differences in immune profiles, with higher immunological scores and more extensive immune infiltration in TAAD. Disulfidptosis occurs in TAAD and is associated with immune cell infiltration and metabolic activity, influencing immune cell function and responses. These findings suggest that disulfidptosis may promote TAAD progression through the induction of immune responses and metabolic activities. This research provides new insights into the pathogenesis and identifies potential therapeutic targets for TAAD.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258895/
2025-04-23 18:19,Deconvolution of cell types and states in spatial multiomics utilizing TACIT.,"Identifying cell types and states remains a time-consuming, error-prone challenge for spatial biology. While deep learning increasingly plays a role, it is difficult to generalize due to variability at the level of cells, neighborhoods, and niches in health and disease. To address this, we develop TACIT, an unsupervised algorithm for cell annotation using predefined signatures that operates without training data. TACIT uses unbiased thresholding to distinguish positive cells from background, focusing on relevant markers to identify ambiguous cells in multiomic assays. Using five datasets (5,000,000 cells; 51 cell types) from three niches (brain, intestine, gland), TACIT outperforms existing unsupervised methods in accuracy and scalability. Integrating TACIT-identified cell types reveals new phenotypes in two inflammatory gland diseases. Finally, using combined spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, we discover under- and overrepresented immune cell types and states in regions of interest, suggesting multimodality is essential for translating spatial biology to clinical applications.",,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258827/

However, applications are currently limited by the lack of accurate and cost-effective sample multiplexing. Here we introduce WarpDemuX, an ultra-fast and highly accurate adapter-barcoding and demultiplexing approach for dRNA-seq with SQK-RNA002 and SQK-RNA004 chemistries. WarpDemuX enhances speed and accuracy by fast processing of the raw nanopore signal, use of a light-weight machine-learning algorithm and design of optimized barcode sets. We demonstrate its utility by performing rapid phenotypic profiling of different SARS-CoV-2 viruses through multiplexed sequencing of longitudinal samples on a single flowcell, identifying systematic differences in transcript abundance and poly(A) tail lengths during infection. Additionally, integrating WarpDemuX into sequencing control software enables real-time enrichment of target molecules through barcode-specific adaptive sampling, which we demonstrate by enriching low abundance viral RNA.

2025-04-23 18:19,Statistical signature of subtle behavioral changes in large-scale assays.,"The central nervous system can generate various behaviors, including motor responses, which we can observe through video recordings. Recent advances in gene manipulation, automated behavioral acquisition at scale, and machine learning enable us to causally link behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms. Moreover, in some animals, such as the Drosophila melanogaster larva, this mapping is possible at the unprecedented scale of single neurons, allowing us to identify the neural microcircuits generating particular behaviors. These high-throughput screening efforts, linking the activation or suppression of specific neurons to behavioral patterns in millions of animals, provide a rich dataset to explore the diversity of nervous system responses to the same stimuli. However, important challenges remain in identifying subtle behaviors, including immediate and delayed responses to neural activation or suppression, and understanding these behaviors on a large scale. We here introduce several statistically robust methods for analyzing behavioral data in response to these challenges: 1) A generative physical model that regularizes the inference of larval shapes across the entire dataset. 2) An unsupervised kernel-based method for statistical testing in learned behavioral spaces aimed at detecting subtle deviations in behavior. 3) A generative model for larval behavioral sequences, providing a benchmark for identifying higher-order behavioral changes. 4) A comprehensive analysis technique using suffix trees to categorize genetic lines into clusters based on common action sequences. We showcase these methodologies through a behavioral screen focused on responses to an air puff, analyzing data from 280 716 larvae across 569 genetic lines.",,MED,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258220/

Still, there are limited numbers of studies using clustering techniques to analyse the recent Global Dietary Database. This study aims to extend an existing multivariate time-series clustering algorithm to allow for greater customisability and to provide the first cluster analysis of the Global Dietary Database to explore temporal trends in country-level nutrition profiles (1990-2018).<h4>Design</h4>Trends in sugar-sweetened beverage intake and nutritional deficiency were explored using the newly developed program 'MTSclust'. Time-series clustering algorithms are different from simple clustering approaches in their ability to appreciate temporal elements.<h4>Setting</h4>Nutritional and demographical data from 176 countries were analysed from the Global Dietary Database.<h4>Participants</h4>Population representative samples of the 176 in the Global Dietary Database.<h4>Results</h4>In a 3-class test specific to the domain, the MTSclust program achieved a mean accuracy of 71.5% (Adjusted Rand Index [ARI]=0.381) while the mean accuracy of a popular algorithm, DTWclust, was 58% (ARI=0.224). The clustering of nutritional deficiency and sugar-sweetened beverage intake identified several common trends among countries and found that these did not change by demographics. Multivariate time-series clustering demonstrated a global convergence towards a Western diet.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While global nutrition trends are associated with geography, demographic variables such as sex and age, are less influential to the trends of certain nutrition intake. The literature could be further supplemented by applying outcome-guided methods to explore how these trends link to disease burdens.",,MED,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40257123/
