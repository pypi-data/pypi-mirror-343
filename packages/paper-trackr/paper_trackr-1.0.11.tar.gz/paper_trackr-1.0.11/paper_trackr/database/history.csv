Current SL prediction models heavily rely on extensive labeled data for specific cell lines to accurately identify SL pairs. However, a major limitation is the scarcity of SL labels across most cell lines, which makes it challenging to predict SL pairs for target cell lines with limited or even no available labels in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, gene interactions could be opposite between training and test cell lines, i.e. SL vs. non-SL, which further aggravates the challenge of generalization among cell lines. A promising strategy is to transfer knowledge learned from cell lines with relatively abundant SL labels to those with limited SL labels for the discovery of novel SL pairs, i.e., cell line-adapted SL prediction. Here, we propose MiT4SL, a multi-omics triplet representation learning model for cell line-adapted SL prediction. The core idea of MiT4SL is to model cell lineage information as embeddings, which are generated by combining a protein-protein interaction network representation tailored to each cell line with the corresponding protein sequence embeddings. We then combine these cell line embeddings with gene pair representations derived from a biomedical knowledge graph and protein sequences. This triplet representation learning strategy enables MiT4SL to capture both shared biological mechanisms across cell lines and those unique to each cell line, effectively mitigating distribution shift and improving generalization to target cell lines. Additionally, explicit cell line embeddings provide the necessary signals for MiT4SL to effectively differentiate between cell line contexts, enabling it to adjust predictions and mitigate possible label conflicts for the same gene pair across different cell lines. Experimental results across various cell line-adapted scenarios show that MiT4SL outperforms six state-of-the-art models. To the best of our knowledge, MiT4SL is the first deep learning model designed specifically for cancer cell line-adapted SL prediction.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.20.649694v1?rss=1

In recent years, long-read sequencing has improved pangenome construction for key eukaryotic species, addressing this issue to some extent. Sufficient-coverage high-fidelity (HiFi) data for population genomics is often prohibitively expensive, limiting its use in large-scale populations and broader eukaryotic species and creating an urgent need for robust ultra-low coverage assemblies. However, current assemblers underperform in such conditions. To address this, we propose HiFiCCL, the first assembly framework specifically designed for ultra-low-coverage high-fidelity reads, using a reference-guided, chromosome-by-chromosome assembly approach. We demonstrate that HiFiCCL improves ultra-low-coverage assembly performance of existing assemblers and outperforms the state-of-the-art assemblers on human and plant datasets. Tested on 45 human datasets (~5x coverage), HiFiCCL combined with hifiasm reduces the length of misassembled contigs relative to hifiasm by an average of 21.19% and up to 38.58%. These improved assemblies enhance germline structural variant detection, reduce chromosome-level mis-scaffolding, enable more accurate pangenome graph construction, and improve the detection of rare and somatic structural variants based on the pangenome graph under ultra-low-coverage conditions.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.20.649739v1?rss=1

As these processes yield trans-bilayer imbalances in lipid numbers, cells must actively flip lipid molecules across the bilayer to enable growth. Using giant and small unilamellar vesicles (GUVs and SUVs, respectively), we here recapitulate cellular growth and division under various conditions of transmembrane flip flop of lipids. By dynamically monitoring the changes in reduced volume and spontaneous curvature of GUVs that grow by fusion of many small SUVs, the morphology of these growing synthetic cells is quantified. We demonstrate that lipid flip flop relaxes curvature stresses and yields more symmetrically sized buds. Further increasing the neck curvature is shown to lead to bud scission.

Their versatility can enable applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and metabolic engineering. This study presents a novel ""semi-trans"" aptazyme-based system for gene regulation in bacteria, expanding the range of GENAs.

While omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)provide multidimensional molecular profiling, their synergistic potential with immunotherapy remains underexplored in large-scale trend analyses. A comprehensive search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection for literature related to omics in tumor immunotherapy, up to August 2024. Bibliometric analyses, conducted using R version 4.3.3, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and Citespace 6.2, examined publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal distributions, keyword co-occurrence, and citation bursts. This analysis of 9,494 publications demonstrates rapid growth in omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research since 2019, with China leading in output (63% of articles) yet exhibiting limited multinational collaboration (7.9% vs. the UK's 61.8%). Keyword co-occurrence and citation burst analyses reveal evolving frontiers: early emphasis on ""PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade"" has transitioned toward ""machine learning,"" ""multi-omics,"" and ""lncRNA,"" reflecting a shift to predictive modeling and biomarker discovery. Multi-omics integration has facilitated the development of immune infiltration-based prognostic models, such as TIME subtypes, which have been validated across multiple tumor types, which inform clinical trial design (e.g. NCT06833723). Additionally, proteomic analysis of melanoma patients suggests that metabolic biomarkers, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, may stratify responders to PD-1 blockade therapy. Moreover, spatial omics has confirmed ENPP1 as a potential novel therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma. Citation trends underscore clinical translation, particularly mutation-guided therapies. Omics technologies are transforming tumor immunotherapy by enhancing biomarker discovery and improving therapeutic predictions. Future advancements will necessitate longitudinal omics monitoring, AI-driven multi-omics integration, and international collaboration to accelerate clinical translation. This study presents a systematic framework for exploring emerging research frontiers and offers insights for optimizing precision-driven immunotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40275437/

2025-04-26 19:39,Integrating bioinformatics and machine learning to discover sumoylation associated signatures in sepsis.,"Teng X, Wang Q, Ma J, Li D.",MED,2025-04-24,,"Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier-mediated modification (SUMOylation) is associated with sepsis; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Herein, hub genes and regulatory mechanisms in sepsis was investigated. The GSE65682 and GSE95233 datasets were extracted from public databases. Differential analysis and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) were conducted in GSE65682 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key module genes. Candidate genes were derived by intersecting with SUMOylation-related genes (SUMO-RGs). The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) were utilized to identify significant feature genes. The convergence of those genes was utilized for diagnostic assessment and expression validation. Hub genes were defined as those exhibiting an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.7, significant gene expression, and a consistent trend. Localization and functional analyses of hub genes were conducted to enhance the understanding of these genes. Immune analysis, regulatory network construction, and drug prediction were performed. Six hub genes were identified: RORA, L3MBTL2, PHC1, RPA1, CHD3, and RANGAP1. These genes possessed considerable diagnostic significance for sepsis and were also markedly downregulated in the condition. Hub genes were predominantly enriched in the ribosome pathway and exhibited a strong correlation with differential immune cells. Activated CD8 + T cells exhibited a positive correlation with RORA. Based on the predicted and established regulatory network, AC004687.1 was observed to modulate PHC1 expression via hsa-miR- 142 - 5p. A total of six hub genes (RORA, L3MBTL2, PHC1, RPA1, CHD3, and RANGAP1) associated with SUMOylation was identified in sepsis in the current study. The findings are likely to aid in the differentiation between control and disease states, offering substantiation for the diagnosis of sepsis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40274894/

To investigate the potential therapeutic targets post-SAH, the SAH-related feature genes were screened by the combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics of rat cortical tissues following SAH and proteomics of cerebrospinal fluid from SAH patients, as well as WGCNA and machine learning. The competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) regulatory networks of the feature genes were constructed and further validated by molecular biology experiments. A total of 1336 differentially expressed proteins were identified, including 729 proteins downregulated and 607 proteins upregulated. The immune microenvironment changed after SAH and the changement persisted at SAH 7d. Through multi-omics and bioinformatics techniques, five SAH-related feature genes (A2M, GFAP, GLIPR2, GPNMB, and LCN2) were identified, closely related to the immune microenvironment. In addition, ceRNAs and TFs regulatory networks of the feature genes were constructed. The increased expression levels of A2M and GLIPR2 following SAH were verified, and co-localization of A2M with intravascular microthrombus was demonstrated. Multiomics and bioinformatics tools were used to predict the SAH associated feature genes confirmed further through the ceRNAs and TFs regulatory network development. These molecules might play a key role in SAH and may serve as potential biological markers and provide clues for exploring therapeutic options.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40274967/

This study combines bioinformatics analysis with machine learning to elucidate potential key mitochondrial-related genes associated with COPD and its immune microenvironment. We utilized the limma package and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to analyze datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE57148), identifying 12 key differentially expressed mitochondrial genes (MitoDEGs). Using 12 distinct machine learning algorithms (comprising 143 predictive models), we identified the optimal diagnostic model, which includes five pivotal MitoDEGs: ERN1, FASTK, HIGD1B, NDUFA7 and NDUFB7. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of each gene, as well as the diagnostic model itself, were evaluated using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. This model demonstrated high specificity in the validation cohorts (GSE76925, GSE151052, GSE239897). Expression analysis revealed upregulation of ERN1 and downregulation of FASTK, HIGD1B, NDUFA7 and NDUFB7 in COPD patients. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated a significant association between MitoDEGs and immune cell infiltration, with ERN1 expression positively correlated with neutrophil infiltration and the other genes negatively correlated. The GABA receptor modulator androstenol was identified as a potential therapeutic candidate. In vivo studies confirmed reduced mRNA expression of HIGD1B and NDUFB7 in COPD mice. These findings elucidate mitochondrial-immune interactions in COPD and highlight novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40274954/

However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles.S2-SPM's superior performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.S2-SPM is implemented and freely available under MIT license at https://github.com/Nicknakis/S2SPM.Available at https://github.com/Nicknakis/S2SPM/blob/main/suppl.pdf.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40266854/

While aging is a well-established risk factor, the underlying mechanisms distinguishing early- and late-onset ovarian cancer remain poorly understood.This study analyzed the global burden and age-related trends of ovarian cancer using the GBD database. A cut-off age of 55 years was used to differentiate between early and late onset ovarian cancer, and a Mendelian randomization method was also used to investigate the causal relationship between aging and ovarian cancer. Machine learning was applied to identify tumor-specific age-associated genes, followed by bioinformatics analyses and single-cell sequencing to explore the roles of these genes and immune profile alterations in ovarian cancer. Additionally, models were constructed, and drug sensitivity analyses performed to evaluate their potential as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets.Ovarian cancer incidence and mortality exhibit age-related trends, with telomere length positively associated with increased risk (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01-1.60, P = 3.90 × 10⁻2). Older patients with OC have a worse prognosis. PRKCD and UCP2 were significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer. PRKCD facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to ovarian cancer progression, while UCP2 modulates ROS dynamics, influencing chemoresistance. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed differences between high- and low-expression groups, particularly in T cells, macrophages, and other immune cells. Both genes are sensitive to a varity of drugs, including dasatinib, fluvastatin, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets.Aging is a significant risk factor for ovarian cancer, with PRKCD and UCP2 closely linked to its onset and progression.
