A comprehensive search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection for literature related to omics in tumor immunotherapy, up to August 2024. Bibliometric analyses, conducted using R version 4.3.3, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and Citespace 6.2, examined publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal distributions, keyword co-occurrence, and citation bursts. This analysis of 9,494 publications demonstrates rapid growth in omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research since 2019, with China leading in output (63% of articles) yet exhibiting limited multinational collaboration (7.9% vs. the UK's 61.8%). Keyword co-occurrence and citation burst analyses reveal evolving frontiers: early emphasis on ""PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade"" has transitioned toward ""machine learning,"" ""multi-omics,"" and ""lncRNA,"" reflecting a shift to predictive modeling and biomarker discovery. Multi-omics integration has facilitated the development of immune infiltration-based prognostic models, such as TIME subtypes, which have been validated across multiple tumor types, which inform clinical trial design (e.g. NCT06833723). Additionally, proteomic analysis of melanoma patients suggests that metabolic biomarkers, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, may stratify responders to PD-1 blockade therapy. Moreover, spatial omics has confirmed ENPP1 as a potential novel therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma. Citation trends underscore clinical translation, particularly mutation-guided therapies. Omics technologies are transforming tumor immunotherapy by enhancing biomarker discovery and improving therapeutic predictions.

Studies have shown that pseudouridine is important in many biological functions such as gene expression, RNA structural stability, and various diseases. Therefore, accurate identification of pseudouridine sites can effectively explain the functional mechanism of this modification site. Due to the rapid increase of genomics data, traditional biological experimental methods to identify RNA modification sites can no longer meet the practical needs, and it is necessary to accurately identify pseudouridine sites from high-throughput RNA sequence data by computational methods. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based computational method, Definer, to accurately identify RNA pseudouridine loci in three species, Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus. The method incorporates two sequence coding schemes, including NCP and One-hot, and then feeds the extracted RNA sequence features into a deep learning model constructed from CNN, GRU and Attention. The benchmark dataset contains data from three species, H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus, and the results using 10-fold cross-validation show that Definer significantly outperforms other existing methods.

These models are fine-tuned after pre-training for specific tasks, such as predicting post-perturbation gene expression profiles, and are considered state-of-the-art for these problems. However, proper benchmarking of these models remains an unsolved challenge. In this study, we benchmarked two recently published foundation models, scGPT and scFoundation, against baseline models. Surprisingly, we found that even the simplest baseline model-taking the mean of training examples-outperformed scGPT and scFoundation.

The current study utilized an innovative 3R infection model featuring the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum infected with Mycobacterium marinum, serving as stand-ins for macrophages and M. tuberculosis, respectively. This high-throughput phenotypic assay allowed for the evaluation of more specific anti-infective activities that may be less prone to resistance mechanisms. To discover novel anti-infective compounds, a diverse collection of 1600 plant NEs from the Pierre Fabre Library was screened using the latter assay. Concurrently, these NEs underwent untargeted UHPLC-HRMS/MS analysis. The biological screening flagged the NE from Stauntonia brunoniana as one of the anti-infective hit NEs. High-resolution HPLC micro-fractionation coupled with bioactivity profiling was employed to highlight the natural products driving this bioactivity. Stilbenes were eventually identified as the primary active compounds in the bioactive fractions.

Although several training prescriptions have been defined with specific merits [1,10-20], the long-term effects of these in terms of their molecular alterations have not yet been well explored. In this study, we focus on two combined endurance and resistance training programs: (1) traditional moderate-intensity continuous endurance and resistance exercise (TRAD) and (2) a variation of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) we refer to as high intensity tactical training (HITT), to assess the dynamics of DNA methylation (DNAm) in blood and muscle derived from males (N=23) and females (N=31), over a 12-week period of training followed by a 4-week period of detraining, sampled at pre-exercise and acute time points, totaling 528 samples.

Current SL prediction models heavily rely on extensive labeled data for specific cell lines to accurately identify SL pairs. However, a major limitation is the scarcity of SL labels across most cell lines, which makes it challenging to predict SL pairs for target cell lines with limited or even no available labels in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, gene interactions could be opposite between training and test cell lines, i.e. SL vs. non-SL, which further aggravates the challenge of generalization among cell lines. A promising strategy is to transfer knowledge learned from cell lines with relatively abundant SL labels to those with limited SL labels for the discovery of novel SL pairs, i.e., cell line-adapted SL prediction. Here, we propose MiT4SL, a multi-omics triplet representation learning model for cell line-adapted SL prediction. The core idea of MiT4SL is to model cell lineage information as embeddings, which are generated by combining a protein-protein interaction network representation tailored to each cell line with the corresponding protein sequence embeddings. We then combine these cell line embeddings with gene pair representations derived from a biomedical knowledge graph and protein sequences. This triplet representation learning strategy enables MiT4SL to capture both shared biological mechanisms across cell lines and those unique to each cell line, effectively mitigating distribution shift and improving generalization to target cell lines. Additionally, explicit cell line embeddings provide the necessary signals for MiT4SL to effectively differentiate between cell line contexts, enabling it to adjust predictions and mitigate possible label conflicts for the same gene pair across different cell lines. Experimental results across various cell line-adapted scenarios show that MiT4SL outperforms six state-of-the-art models.

Sufficient-coverage high-fidelity (HiFi) data for population genomics is often prohibitively expensive, limiting its use in large-scale populations and broader eukaryotic species and creating an urgent need for robust ultra-low coverage assemblies.

2025-04-26 23:31,Comparative analysis of genomic prediction approaches for multiple time-resolved traits in maize,"Hobby, D., Lindner, R., Mbebi, A. J., Tong, H., Nikoloski, Z.",bioRxiv,2025-04-24,,"Ability to accurately predict multiple growth-related traits over plant developmental trajectories has the potential to revolutionize crop breeding and precision agriculture. Despite increased availability of time-resolved data for multiple traits from high-throughput phenotyping platforms of model plants and crops, genomic prediction is largely applied to a small number of traits, often neglecting their dynamics. Here, we compared and contrasted the performance of MegaLMM and dynamicGP as well as their hybrid variants that can handle high-dimensional temporal data for multi-trait genomic prediction. The comparative analysis made use of time series for 50 geometric, colour, and texture traits in a maize multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population. The performance of the approaches was assessed using snapshot accuracy and longitudinal accuracy, providing insight into the ability to predict multiple traits at a single time point or the dynamics of individual traits over the considered time domain, respectively. We found that MegaLMM outperforms dynamicGP in terms of snapshot accuracy, while dynamicGP proved superior in terms of longitudinal accuracy. This study paves the way for careful investigation of factors that affect the capacity to predict dynamics of multiple traits from genetic markers alone.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.649925v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"
2025-04-26 23:31,BioMiner: A Multi-modal System for Automated Mining of Protein-Ligand Bioactivity Data from Literature,"Yan, J., Zhu, J., Yang, Y., Liu, Q., Zhang, K., Zhang, Z., Liu, X., Zhang, B., Gao, K., Xiao, J., Chen, E.",bioRxiv,2025-04-24,,"Protein-ligand bioactivity data published in literature are essential for drug discovery, yet manual curation struggles to keep pace with rapidly growing literature. Automated bioactivity extraction is challenging due to the multi-modal distribution of information (text, tables, figures, structures) and the complexity of chemical representations (e.g., Markush structures). Furthermore, the lack of standardized benchmarks impedes the evaluation and development of extraction methods. In this work, we introduce BioMiner, a multi-modal system designed to automatically extract protein-ligand bioactivity data from thousands to potentially millions of publications. BioMiner employs a modular, agent-based architecture, leveraging a synergistic combination of multi-modal large language models, domain-specific models, and domain tools to navigate this complex extraction task. To address the benchmark gap and support method development, we establish BioVista, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 16,457 bioactivity entries and 8,735 chemical structures curated from 500 publications. On BioVista, BioMiner validates its extraction ability and provides a quantitative baseline, achieving F1 scores of 0.22, 0.45, and 0.53 for bioactivity triplets, chemical structures, and bioactivity measurement with high throughput (14s/paper on 8 V100 GPUs). We further demonstrate BioMiner's practical utility via three applications: (1) extracting 67,953 data from 11,683 papers to build a pre-training database that improves downstream models performance by 3.1%; (2) enabling a human-in-the-loop workflow that doubles the number of high-quality NLRP3 bioactivity data, helping 38.6% improvement over 28 QSAR models and identification of 16 hit candidates with novel scaffolds; and (3) accelerating the annotation of the protein-ligand structures in PoseBusters benchmark with reported bioactivity, achieving a 5-fold speed increase and 10% accuracy improvement over manual methods. BioMiner and BioVista provide a scalable extraction methodology and a rigorous benchmark, paving the way to unlock vast amounts of previously inaccessible bioactivity data and accelerate data-driven drug discovery.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.648951v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"

M.",bioRxiv,2025-04-24,,"Genomes from metagenomes have revolutionised our understanding of microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution, propelling advances in basic science, biomedicine, and biotechnology. Assembly algorithms that take advantage of increasingly available long-read sequencing technologies bring the recovery of complete genomes directly from metagenomes within reach. However, assessing the accuracy of the assembled long reads, especially from complex environments that often include poorly studied organisms, poses remarkable challenges. Here we show that erroneous reporting is pervasive among long-read assemblers and can take many forms, including multi-domain chimeras, prematurely circularized sequences, haplotyping errors, excessive repeats, and phantom sequences. Our study highlights the need for rigorous evaluation of the algorithms while they are in development, and options for users who may opt for more accurate reads than shorter runtimes.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.649783v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"

The results obtained using the highly accurate reads generated by PacBio HiFi have been particularly notable yielding hundreds of circularized, complete genomes as metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) without manual intervention. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has recently improved the accuracy of its sequencing reads, achieving a per-base error rate of approximately 1-2%. Given the high-throughput, convenience and low-cost of ONT sequencing this could accelerate the uptake of long read metagenomics. However, current metagenome assemblers are optimized for PacBio HiFi data and underperform on the latest ONT data and do not scale to the large data sets that it enables. We present nanoMDBG, an evolution of the metaMDBG HiFi assembler, designed to support newer ONT sequencing data through a novel pre-processing step that performs fast and accurate error correction in minimizer-space. Across a range of ONT datasets, including a large 400 Gbp soil sample sequenced specifically for this study, nanoMDBG reconstructs up to twice as many high-quality MAGs as the next best ONT assembler, metaflye, while requiring a third of the CPU time and memory. As a result of these advances, we show that the latest ONT technology can now produce results comparable to those obtained using PacBio HiFi sequencing at the same sequencing depth.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.649928v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"

Genetic circuits have successfully been designed to respond to specific analytes and produce quantifiable outputs; however, multiplexed signal processing remains challenging. This limitation is partially due to crosstalk, or sensors' non-specific responses to unintended signals. While strategies to achieve orthogonality are promising, they are time-intensive and context-dependent. Here, we introduce a new, generalizable approach that leverages microbial consortia to distribute sensory functions and computational methods to disentangle signals. Compartmentalizing sensor circuits within distinct populations simplifies experimental optimization by allowing individual populations to be exchanged without requiring genetic modifications. Our computational pipeline combines mechanistic modeling with machine learning to decode microbial communities' unique temporal responses and predict multiple input concentrations. We demonstrated this platform's versatility in a variety of contexts: measuring signals with high crosstalk, detecting antibiotics with natural microbial communities, and quantifying chemicals in hospital sink wastewater. Our findings highlight how combining microbial engineering with computational strategies can produce robust, scalable biosensors for diverse applications.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.23.650302v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, synthetic biology"

There have been 70 human cases of H5N1 influenza in the United States since April 2024 and, as shown in recent studies, our current antibody defenses are waning. Thus, it is imperative to discover new therapeutics in the fight against more recent strains of the virus. In this study, we present the Frankies framework for automated antibody diffusion and assessment. This pipeline was used to automate the generation of 30 novel anti-HA1 Fv antibody fragment sequences, fold them into 3-dimensional structures, and then dock against a recent H5N1 HA1 antigen structure for binding evaluation. Here we show the utility of artificial intelligence in the discovery of novel antibodies against specific H5N1 strains of interest, which bind similarly to known therapeutic and elicited antibodies.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.24.650061v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, synthetic biology"

B., Dekker, C.",bioRxiv,2025-04-24,,"Cells grow their boundaries by incorporating newly synthesized lipids into their membranes as well as through fusion of intracellular vesicles. As these processes yield trans-bilayer imbalances in lipid numbers, cells must actively flip lipid molecules across the bilayer to enable growth. Using giant and small unilamellar vesicles (GUVs and SUVs, respectively), we here recapitulate cellular growth and division under various conditions of transmembrane flip flop of lipids. By dynamically monitoring the changes in reduced volume and spontaneous curvature of GUVs that grow by fusion of many small SUVs, the morphology of these growing synthetic cells is quantified. We demonstrate that lipid flip flop relaxes curvature stresses and yields more symmetrically sized buds. Further increasing the neck curvature is shown to lead to bud scission. The mechanisms presented here offer fundamental insights into cell growth and division, which are important for understanding early protocells and designing synthetic cells that are able to grow and divide.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.23.650179v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, synthetic biology"

B.",bioRxiv,2025-04-24,,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are multimodular enzymes that produce complex peptides with diverse biological activities, potentially being used as clinical drugs. However, the pharmaceutical applications of such natural peptides often require further derivatisation and modification of the peptide backbone, mainly performed by chemical synthesis. A sustainable alternative resembles the in vivo engineering of NRPS to change and modify the enzyme properties rationally and, thus, the produced products. The novel NRPS engineering concept, the eXchange Unit Thiolation domain (XUT), allows the efficient modular assembly of different natural NRPS fragments to form hybrid NRPS that produce defined peptides. In this study, we describe a Golden Gate assembly (GGA) method for efficient high-throughput generation of novel and engineered NRPS libraries utilising the XUT concept. This method was applied to generate over 100 novel NRPS with the possibility of changing starter, elongation, and termination modules, respectively. Additionally, we applied this method for targeted modification of the xenoamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) XabABCD from Xenorhabdus doucetiae, resulting in the generation of 25 novel xenoamicin derivatives.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.23.650154v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, synthetic biology"

E., Perreault, J.",bioRxiv,2025-04-24,,"Nucleic acid-based regulatory elements capable of modulating gene expression in response to specific molecular cues have gained increasing attention in synthetic biology. These systems, which include riboswitches, allosteric DNAzymes, and aptazymes, function as Gene Expression Nucleic Allosteric actuators (GENAs) by coupling molecular recognition with genetic regulation. Their versatility can enable applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and metabolic engineering. This study presents a novel ""semi-trans"" aptazyme-based system for gene regulation in bacteria, expanding the range of GENAs. The system employs theophylline-responsive hammerhead ribozyme aptazymes positioned in the 5' UnTranslated Region (UTR), designed to cleave within the coding sequence of the target gene, thereby modulating gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner. Using the tetA gene in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a proof of concept, we demonstrate ligand-controlled regulation of tetracycline resistance and nickel sensitivity. The system's effectiveness is validated through in vitro cleavage assays and in vivo phenotypic studies in two E. coli strains, highlighting its portability across genetic backgrounds.
