# Domilite

Domilite is a Python library for creating and manipulating HTML elements.

It takes inspiration from [dominate][], a great library for creating HTML elements in Python. Domilite aims to simplify the interface from [dominate][], providing a smaller set of APIs while maintaining general compatibility with the library.
