# Dia-JAX

**An experimental JAX port of Dia, the 1.6B parameter text-to-speech model from Nari Labs**

## Quickstart

**Note: Currently only recommended for experimental/development use due to memory issues**

[output.mp3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaco-bro/diajax/main/assets/example_output.mp3)

```bash
pip install diajax
dia --text "[S1] Dear Jacks, to generate audio from text from any machine. [S2] Any machine? (gasps) How? [S1] With flakes and an axe. (chuckle) " --max-tokens=100
```

```python
import diajax
model, config = diajax.load()
output = diajax.generate(model, config, text)
diajax.save(output)
```
