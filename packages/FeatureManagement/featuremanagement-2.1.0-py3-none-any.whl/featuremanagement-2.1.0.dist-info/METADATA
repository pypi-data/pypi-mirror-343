# Microsoft Feature Management for Python

[![FeatureManagement](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/FeatureManagement?label=FeatureManagement)](https://pypi.org/project/FeatureManagement/)

Feature management provides a way to develop and expose application functionality based on features. Many applications have special requirements when a new feature is developed such as when the feature should be enabled and under what conditions. This library provides a way to define these relationships, and also integrates into common Python code patterns to make exposing these features possible.

## Get Started

[Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-feature-flag-python): A quickstart guide is available to learn how to integrate feature flags from Azure App Configuration into your Python applications.

[API Reference](https://microsoft.github.io/FeatureManagement-Python/): This API reference details the API surface of the libraries contained within this repository.

## Examples

* [Python Application](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Python/blob/main/samples/feature_flag_sample.py)
* [Python Application with Feature Variants](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Python/blob/main/samples/feature_variant_sample.py)
* [Python Application with Azure App Configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Python/blob/main/samples/feature_flag_with_azure_app_configuration_sample.py)
* [Django Application](https://github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration/tree/main/examples/Python/python-django-webapp-sample)
* [Flask Application](https://github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration/tree/main/examples/Python/python-flask-webapp-sample)
