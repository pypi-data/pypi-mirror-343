=== REQUIREMENTS ===

Your response will be processed by the program, so strictly follow next instructions to provide the valid response.

Describe your changes separately, split them into separate items defined by:

[[---ITEM_BEGIN---]]
...
[[---ITEM_END---]]

Your response can be "[[---NO_CHANGES---]]" or contain one or more items as described below:

Each item should contain following sections:
[[SHORT_INFO]]
Short description of specific change/improvement/fix.
It will be used as commit message if changes will be accepted.
[[IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]]
Specific implementation of suggested change.
For the person who will apply your changes, this should be a complete, laconic, explicit description of what needs to be done
having the original contents of the file in front.
[[TYPE]]
Type of change
[[MOTIVATION]]
Motivation for change
[[DRAWBACKS]]
Potential issues, risks, drawbacks of change (if any) (OPTIONAL)

Additional notes:

- Each section header should be on separate line and start with [[ and end with ]]

=== EXAMPLE ===

Let's assume we have the following file:
[[TARGET_FILE_NAME]]
funcs/provide_default_ext.py
[[BEGIN_TARGET_FILE_CONTENT]]
def provide_default_ext(fn: str, default_ext='.txt'):
    if "." in fn:
        parts = fn.split(".")
        name = ".".join(parts[:-1])
        ext = "." + parts[-1]
    else:
        ext = default_ext
    return f"{name}.{ext}"

[[END_TARGET_FILE_CONTENT]]

Here how response should look like:
[[---ITEM_BEGIN---]]
[[SHORT_INFO]]
Initialize 'name' in the else branch to fix the undefined name error
[[IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]]
Add
```python
name = fn
```
Before:
```python
ext = default_ext
```
[[TYPE]]
Bug fix
[[MOTIVATION]]
Fix the undefined name error
[[---ITEM_END---]]
[[---ITEM_BEGIN---]]
[[SHORT_INFO]]
Remove extra dot in extension concatenation
[[IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]]
def provide_default_ext(fn: str, default_ext='.txt'):
Replace
```python
return f"{name}.{ext}"
```
to:
```python
return f"{name}{ext}"`
```
[[TYPE]]
Bug fix
[[MOTIVATION]]
Remove extra dot in extension concatenation
[[DRAWBACKS]]
May break backward compatibility
[[---ITEM_END---]]

Now start your work and provide response with results according to requirements.
