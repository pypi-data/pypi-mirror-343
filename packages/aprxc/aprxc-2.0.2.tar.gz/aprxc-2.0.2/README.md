# aprxc

A command-line tool (and Python class) to approximately count the number of
distinct elements in files (or a stream/pipe) using the “simple, intuitive,
sampling-based space-efficient algorithm” by S. Chakraborty, N. V. Vinodchandran
and K. S. Meel, as described in their 2023 paper [Distinct Elements in Streams:
An Algorithm for the (Text) Book](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10191#section.2).

**Motivation:** Easier to remember, always faster and (much) less
memory-intensive than `sort | uniq | wc -l` or `awk '!a[$0]++' | wc -l`. In this
implementation’s default configuration results are precise until ~83k unique
values (on 64-bit CPUs), with deviations of commonly 0.4-1% afterwards.

## Installation

Choose your preferred way to install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aprxc/):

```shell
pip install aprxc
uv tool install aprxc
```

Alternatively, run it in an isolated environment, using [pipx
run](https://pipx.pypa.io/) or [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/):

```shell
pipx run aprxc --help
uvx aprxc --help
```

Lastly, as `aprxc.py` has no dependencies besides Python 3.11+, you can simply
download the script, run it, put it your PATH, vendor it, etc.

## Features and shortcomings

* Easier to remember than the pipe constructs.
* 20–60% faster than sort/uniq.
* 30–99% less memory-intensive than sort/uniq (for mid/high-cardinality data)
* (Roughly double these numbers when compared against awk.)
* Memory usage has a (configurable) upper bound.

Now let's address the elephant in the room: These advantages are bought with
**an inaccuracy in the reported results**. But how inaccurate?

### About inaccuracy

In its default configuration the algorithm has a **mean inaccuracy of about
0.4%**, with **outliers around 1%**. For example, if the script encounters 10M
(`10_000_000`) actual unique values, the reported count is typically ~40k off
(e.g. `10_038_680`), sometimes ~100k (e.g. `9_897_071`).

**However:** If the number of encountered actual unique elements is smaller than
the size of the internally used set data structure, then the reported counts are
**exact**; only once this limit is reached, the approximation algorithm 'kicks
in' and the result will become an approximation.

Here's an overview (highly unscientific!) of how the algorithm parameters 𝜀 and
𝛿 (`--epsilon` and `--delta` on the command line) affect the inaccuracy. The
default of `0.1` for both values seems to strike a good balance (and a memorable
inaccuracy of ~1%). Epsilon is the 'main manipulation knob', and you can see
quite good how its value affects especially the maximum inaccuracy.

For this first table I counted 10 million unique 32-character strings, and for
each iteration checked the reported count and compared to the actual number of
unique items. _Mean inacc._ is the mean inaccuracy across all 10M steps; _max
inacc._ is the highest deviation encountered; _memory usage_ is the linux tool
`time`'s reported _maxresident_; _time usage_ is wall time.

### Is it useful?

You have to accept the inaccuracies, obviously. But if you are working
exploratory and don't care about exact number or plan to round or throw them
away anyway; or if or you are in a memory-constrained situation and need to deal
with large input files or streaming data; or if you just cannot remember the
multi-command pipe alternatives, then this might be a tool for you.

### The experimental 'top most common' feature

I've added a couple of lines of code to support a 'top most common' items
feature. An alternative to the `sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head`-pipeline or
[Tim Bray's nice `topfew` tool (written in
Go)](https://github.com/timbray/topfew/).

It kinda works, but…

- The counts are good, even surprisingly good, as for the whole base algorithm,
  but definitely worse and not as reliable as the nice 1%-mean-inaccuracy for
  the total count case.
- I lack the mathematical expertise to prove or disprove anything about that
  feature.
- If you ask for a top 10 (`-t10` or `--top 10`), you mostly get what you
  expect, but if the counts are close the lower ranks become 'unstable'; even
  rank 1 and 2 sometimes switch places etc.
- Compared with `topfew` (I wondered if this approximation algorithm could be
  _an optional_ flag for `topfew`), this Python code is impressively close to
  the Go performance, especially if reading a lot of data from a pipe.
  Unfortunately, I fear that this algorithm is not parallelizable. But I leave
  that, and the re-implementation in Go or Rust, as an exercise for the reader
  :)
- Just try it!

## Command-line interface

```shell
usage: aprxc [-h] [--top [X]] [--size SIZE] [--epsilon EPSILON]
             [--delta DELTA] [--cheat] [--count-total] [--verbose] [--version]
             [--debug]

Aproximately count the number of distinct lines in a file or pipe.

positional arguments:

  --top [X], -t [X]     EXPERIMENTAL: Show X most common values. Off by
                        default. If enabled, X defaults to 10.
  --size SIZE, -s SIZE  Expected (estimated) total number of items. Reduces
                        memory usages, increases inaccuracy.
  --epsilon EPSILON, -E EPSILON

  --cheat               Improve accuracy by tracking 'total seen' and use it
                        as upper bound for result.
  --count-total, -T     Count number of total seen values.
  --verbose, -v
  --version, -V         show program's version number and exit
  --debug               Track, calculate, and display various internal
                        statistics.
