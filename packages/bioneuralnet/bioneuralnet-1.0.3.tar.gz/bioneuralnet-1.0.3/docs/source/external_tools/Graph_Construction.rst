Graph Construction
==================

These wrappers facilitate calling **R-based** adjacency-building approaches:

**SmCCNet**:
  - Constructs networks via sparse canonical correlation. Ideal for multi-omics correlation or partial correlation tasks.

**WGCNA**:
  - Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis wrapper for R's WGCNA package.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/wgcna_example.py
   :language: python

**Note**:
  
  - You must have R installed, plus the respective CRAN packages (e.g. “WGCNA” or “SmCCNet”), for these wrappers to work.
  - The adjacency matrices generated here can then be passed to GNNEmbedding, DPMON, or other BioNeuralNet modules.
