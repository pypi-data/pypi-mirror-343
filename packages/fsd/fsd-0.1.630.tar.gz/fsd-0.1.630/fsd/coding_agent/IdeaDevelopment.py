            "ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES:\n"
            "- Modularity: Break down systems into small, focused components with single responsibilities\n"

            "- Decoupling: Ensure minimal dependencies between components\n"
            "- Scalability: Design small, independent services that can scale individually\n"
            "- Maintainability: Favor many simple files over complex monolithic structures\n"
            "- Testability: Small components are easier to test in isolation\n"
            "- Reusability: Smaller components promote code reuse across the application\n"
