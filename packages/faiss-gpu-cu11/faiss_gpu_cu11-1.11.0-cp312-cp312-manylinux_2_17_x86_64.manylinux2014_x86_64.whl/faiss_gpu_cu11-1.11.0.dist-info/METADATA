# faiss-wheels

This repository is based on [kyamagu/faiss-wheels](https://github.com/kyamagu/faiss-wheels).

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/faiss-gpu-cu11?label=faiss-gpu-cu11)](https://pypi.org/project/faiss-gpu-cu11/)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/faiss-gpu-cu12?label=faiss-gpu-cu12)](https://pypi.org/project/faiss-gpu-cu12/)

## Overview

This repository provides scripts to build gpu wheels for the [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) library.
Distribute the `faiss-gpu-cuXX` package to PyPI using the contents of this repository. 

* Builds CUDA 11.8+/CUDA 12.1+ compatible wheels.
  * Support Volta\~Ada Lovelace architecture GPU (Compute Capability 7.0\~8.9).
  * **Dynamically linked to CUDA Runtime and cuBLAS libraries published in PyPI.**
* Bundles OpenBLAS in Linux.


## Installation

The `faiss-gpu-cu11` and `faiss-gpu-cu12` wheels built for CUDA11 and CUDA12 are available on PyPI.
Install one or the other depending on your environment.
These wheels dynamically link to the CUDA Runtime and cuBLAS shared libraries. This approach helps to reduce the file size of the wheels.

`faiss-gpu-cuXX(XX=11 or 12)` has dependencies on CUDA Runtime (`nvidia-cuda-runtime-cuXX`) and cuBLAS (`nvidia-cublas-cuXX`) released by PyPI, and links shared libraries in these packages. 
**Therefore, there is no need to install CUDA on your host(system).**

### <span style="color: red; ">Caution</span>

The published `faiss-gpu-cuXX` package requires proper setup of system, hardware, and other dependencies that cannot be managed by the package manager (e.g. pip).
It is the responsibility of the user of this package to prepare an environment suitable for its operation.

Here are the main requirements that such an environment should meet (Other conditions may be hidden.)

1. the host environment must have a CUDA-compatible Nvidia Driver installed, as required by `faiss-gpu-cuXX` (see below for details)
2. the GPU architecture of the execution environment must be compatible with `faiss-gpu-cuXX` (see below for details)
3. if you install `faiss-gpu-cuXX` and another library (e.g. Pytorch) that uses dynamically linked CUDA in the same environment, they must be linked to the same CUDA shared library.

### Wheel for CUDA12

`faiss-gpu-cu12` is a package built using CUDA Toolkit 12.1.
The following command will install faiss and the CUDA Runtime and cuBLAS for CUDA 12.1 used at build time.

```bash
# install CUDA 12.1 at the same time
$ pip install faiss-gpu-cu12[fix-cuda]
```

**Requirements**
* OS: Linux
  * arch: x86_64
  * glibc >=2.17
* Nvidia driver: >=R530 (specify `fix-cuda` extra during installation)
* GPU architectures: Volta\~Ada Lovelace (Compute Capability: 7.0\~8.9)

**Advanced**

The `faiss-gpu-cu12` package (the binaries contained in it) is minor version compatible with CUDA and will work dynamically linked with CUDA 12.X (X>=1).

Installation of the CUDA runtime and cuBLAS is allowed to the extent that minor version compatibility is maintained by excluding the `fix-cuda` extra.

This is useful when coexisting this package with a package that has a dependency on the CUDA Toolkit used at build time, such as Pytorch or Tensorflow.

The installation commands are as follows.

```bash
# install CUDA 12.X(X>=1) at the same time
$ pip install faiss-gpu-cu12
```

If you install the `faiss-gpu-cuXX` package in this way, CUDA may be updated due to lock file updates, etc.

Please note that this may cause an error depending on the compatibility with the driver. (Basically, to use a new CUDA, the driver must also be updated).


### Wheel for CUDA11

`faiss-gpu-cu11` is a package built using CUDA Toolkit 11.8.
The following command will install faiss and the CUDA Runtime and cuBLAS for CUDA 11.8 used at build time.

```bash
# install CUDA 11.8 at the same time
$ pip install faiss-gpu-cu11[fix-cuda]
```

**Requirements**
* OS: Linux
  * arch: x86_64
  * glibc >=2.17
* Nvidia driver: >=R520 (specify `fix-cuda` extra during installation)
* GPU architectures: Volta\~Ada Lovelace (Compute Capability: 7.0\~8.9)

**Advanced**

Since CUDA 11.8 is the final version of the CUDA 11 series, the results are the same with or without the `fix-cuda` extras.

```bash
# install CUDA 11.X(X>=8) at the same time
$ pip install faiss-gpu-cu11
```

### Versioning rule

Basically, it follows the versioning rules of the original faiss repository.
If there is a defect in the changed part in this repository, it will be updated with `postN` (N>=1) at the end of the version.

## Usage

You can build `faiss-gpu-cu11` and `faiss-gpu-cu12` wheels using [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).

```bash
# Number of processes used when building faiss
$ export NJOB="32"
# Optimization level of faiss
$ export FAISS_OPT_LEVEL="generic"
# Build target nvidia gpu architectures
$ export CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="70-real;80-real"
# If no tests are performed at build time for cibuildwheel
$ export CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_LINUX=""
# If tests are performed at build time for cibuildwheel
$ export CIBW_CONTAINER_ENGINE='docker; create_args: --gpus all'

# build faiss-gpu-cu11 wheels
$ uvx cibuildwheel@2.23.2 variant/gpu-cu11 --output-dir wheelhouse/gpu-cu11
# build faiss-gpu-cu12 wheels
$ uvx cibuildwheel@2.23.2 variant/gpu-cu12 --output-dir wheelhouse/gpu-cu12
```

When executed, a wheel is created under "{repository root}/wheelhouse/gpu-cuXX".

**Requirements**
* OS: Linux
  * arch: x86_64
* Nvidia container toolkit (If test is performed)
* Nvidia driver: >=R530 (If test is performed)
