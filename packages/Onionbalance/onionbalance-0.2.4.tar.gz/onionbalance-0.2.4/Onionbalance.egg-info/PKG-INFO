# Onionbalance

![Onionbalance Logo](docs/assets/onionbalance.jpg "Onionbalance")

# Introduction

Onionbalance allows Tor Onion Service requests to be distributed across
multiple backend Tor instances. Onionbalance provides load-balancing while also
making Onion Services more resilient and reliable by eliminating single
points-of-failure and by protecting the identity key.
