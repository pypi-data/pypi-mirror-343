          "details": "Implementation steps:\n1. Modify the config loader to parse OpenAI embedding configuration:\n   - Add a new section in config.yml schema for `embedding_provider`\n   - Support parameters including:\n     - `provider_type: \"openai\"` (for future extensibility)\n     - `model_name: \"text-embedding-3-small\"` (with appropriate defaults)\n     - `api_key` (with support for environment variable references)\n     - `dimensions` (optional, defaulting to model's standard dimension)\n     - `timeout_seconds` and other request parameters\n\n2. Implement configuration validation:\n   - Check for required fields\n   - Validate model names against allowed values\n   - Provide helpful error messages for misconfiguration\n\n3. Create a factory function/class that:\n   - Takes the parsed configuration\n   - Returns the appropriate `EmbeddingProvider` instance\n   - Uses sensible defaults if specific config is missing\n\n4. Update example config files and documentation:\n   - Add embedding configuration examples to template config.yml\n   - Document all available options in the config documentation\n\nTesting approach:\n- Test parsing of various valid configuration formats\n- Test validation error handling for invalid configurations\n- Verify factory correctly instantiates the right provider with correct parameters\n\n<info added on 2025-04-25T19:14:52.027Z>\nFor the design crossroad regarding embedding providers:\n\nRecommended approach: Implement option 1 (provider_type switch) now with a clean abstraction that will support option 2 later:\n\n```python\nclass EmbeddingProviderFactory:\n    @staticmethod\n    def create_provider(config):\n        provider_type = config.get(\"provider_type\", \"local\")\n        if provider_type == \"openai\":\n            return OpenAIEmbeddingProvider(config)\n        elif provider_type == \"local\":\n            return LocalEmbeddingProvider(config)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported embedding provider: {provider_type}\")\n```\n\nImplementation considerations:\n- Create a base `EmbeddingProvider` abstract class with common interface methods\n- Add configuration validation for each provider type\n- For local models, include parameters like:\n  - `model_name: \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"` (default)\n  - `device: \"cpu\"` or `\"cuda\"`\n  - `cache_folder` for model storage\n- Add a utility function that returns the current active provider\n\nThis approach offers the best balance of immediate functionality while laying groundwork for future runtime switching if needed. It keeps the config-driven approach simple while ensuring the architecture can evolve.\n</info added on 2025-04-25T19:14:52.027Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-25T19:24:47.790Z>\n<info added on 2025-04-26T08:30:15.123Z>\nExcellent progress! The smoke tests confirm our implementation is working correctly. Here are some final recommendations before closing this subtask:\n\n1. Add a simple integration test that verifies the full config-to-query pipeline:\n```python\ndef test_embedding_provider_end_to_end():\n    # Test with minimal viable config for each provider type\n    for provider_config in [\n        {\"provider_type\": \"openai\", \"api_key\": \"test_key\", \"model_name\": \"text-embedding-3-small\"},\n        {\"provider_type\": \"local\", \"model_name\": \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"}\n    ]:\n        config = Config({\"embedding\": provider_config})\n        memory = VectorMemory(config)\n        \n        # Simple smoke test of embedding and retrieval\n        memory.add(\"test document\", metadata={\"source\": \"test\"})\n        results = memory.search(\"test query\", limit=1)\n        \n        assert len(results) > 0\n        assert results[0].metadata[\"source\"] == \"test\"\n```\n\n2. Final documentation updates needed:\n   - Add a section in the README about embedding provider configuration\n   - Document performance characteristics and token usage for each provider\n   - Include a troubleshooting section for common configuration issues\n\n3. Before marking complete, ensure:\n   - All environment variable substitutions are properly handled (e.g., `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`)\n   - Config validation provides actionable error messages\n   - Default values are sensible and documented\n\nThe implementation is indeed minimal and backward-compatible. The abstraction is clean with good separation of concerns between configuration and implementation. This subtask can be marked complete after these final documentation updates.\n</info added on 2025-04-26T08:30:15.123Z>\n</info added on 2025-04-25T19:24:47.790Z>",
