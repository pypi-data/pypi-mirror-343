I recently designed and launched a platform that encourages responsible use of AI, focused towards middle school and high school students. The platform, AI Tutors, leverages LLMs to power chat bots designed to help foster critical thinking, creativity, and deeper understanding of particular subjects/topics. 

The alignment aspect of this project is two-fold:

Each AI tutor has two components: the main LLM instance which attempts to align its responses with a set of system instructions and a secondary LLM instance that moderates the responses using a set of pre-defined guidelines, iteratively correcting any responses that violate these guidelines.
The platform leverages the expertise and classroom experience of actual teachers to design and iterate on the instructions and guidelines for each AI tutor. Teachers can build, edit, and share the tutors they develop so that they are aligned with their own teaching practices and philosophies.
