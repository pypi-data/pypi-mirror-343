# Versions

## Development
- 0.0.22 Picks.remove_phases_randomly() -> phase_removal function: control nan dataframes
- 0.0.21 EQWindow Parameter:  
    - length-> maximum length (We want to define a maximum length, but a window with variable length)
    - get_stats -> stats of the picks in the window
    - pick_type and pick_id columns for Pick object
    - get_events_wtime -> To get the time of the events in the window.
    - eqw.ev_ids to get the ids of the events.
- 0.0.20 Trace plot. Adding trace plot. see examples (utd_plots)
- 0.0.19 EQWindow class argument: Keep_order: This ensures that the order of events in your picks is preserved. 
- 0.0.18 Adding query function to catalog, and filtering picks of the events in get_picks function.
- 0.0.17 Fixing bug detected by Riven (add_artificial_picks and remove_phases_randomly)
- 0.0.16 eda functions (riven)
- 0.0.15 pytable requirement
- 0.0.14 Window
- 0.0.13 Picks - add_artificial_picks, plot

            - scanner:
                - scan: Scan the waveform data for each provider and save results to the database.
                - get_stats: Retrieve statistical data from database files based on the provided criteria.
            - plot_rolling_stats: Plots rolling statistics data as a heatmap with optional color bar and time axis customization.
