# qiskit-connector

**‚öõÔ∏èQiskit 2.x Connector for IBM Quantum Backends in Realtime**

A Quantum helper package compatible with Qiskit v2.x which streamlines authentication, plan detection, and backend selection for Qiskit RuntimeService. This package performs the following:
- Loads environment variables from config file (e.g. `.env`) via `python-dotenv` to configure your IBM Quantum account and make the `backend` object available in your quantum code for reuse in real-time.
- Detects your active plan (Open, Standard, Premium, Dedicated) and sets up the correct channel/instance.
- Provides functions to save your account (`qiskit_save_connection`), verify QPU resources (`qpu_verify`, `is_verified`), and retrieve a ready-to-use backend (`connector()`).

###### üêç Package built and maintained by Dr. Jeffrey Chijioke-Uche, IBM Quantum Ambassador & Research Scientist.
###### üêç Package is globally available in Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-connector

## üìã Features & API

All of the following functions are available after you import the module:

```python
from qiskit_connector import (
    connector,
    plan_type,
    qpu_verify,
    is_verified
)
```

- **`qiskit_save_connection(plan_type: str)`**  
  Saves your IBM Quantum account into QiskitRuntimeService using the environment variables for the given plan (`"open"`, `"standard"`, `"premium"`, or `"dedicated"`).

- **`qpu_verify()`**  
  Lists available QPUs for your plan by querying `QiskitRuntimeService.backends()` or falling back to `paid_plans()` for paid plans.

- **`is_verified()`**  
  Verifies real‚Äêtime least-busy QPU for the active plan and prints details (name, qubit count, online date).

- **`connector() -> IBMBackend`**  
  **Main entry point**: Loads your saved account, picks the least busy QPU (or first available for open or paid plans), prints diagnostics, and returns an `IBMBackend` instance ready for circuit execution.

- **`plan_type() -> str`**  
  Returns either **"Open Plan"** or **"Paid Plan"** depending on your `.env` toggles.

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install qiskit-connector
```

This will also pull in:

- `qiskit>=2.0.0`  
- `qiskit-ibm-runtime>=0.37.0`  
- `python-dotenv`  
- `requests`  

and any other Qiskit dependencies.

## üóÇÔ∏è Environment (.env) Setup
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Practice: Do not CHECK-IN `.env` into version control. Add it to your .gitignore.
During development, create a file named `.env` at your project root. The connector will automatically load it:

```dotenv

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file is used to store environment variables for the Qiskit installation wizard: Update it.
# The "ibm_quantum" channel option is deprecated and will be sunset on 1 July 2025.
# After this date, ibm_cloud will be the only valid channel.
# For information on migrating to the new IBM Quantum Platform on the "ibm_cloud" channel,
# review the migration guide https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/migration-guides/classic-iqp-to-cloud-iqp .

## üìñ Quickstart Examples

### Open Plan (default free tier) and Paid Plan

```python

from qiskit_connector import connector, plan_type
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import SamplerV2 as Sampler, Session

# QPU execution mode by plan:
current = plan_type()
backend = connector()

if current == "Open Plan":  # session not supported
    sampler = Sampler(mode=backend)
    print("Your Plan:", current)
    print("Least Busy QPU:", backend.name)
elif current == "Paid Plan":  # supports session
    with Session(backend=backend.name) as session:
        sampler = Sampler(mode=session)
        print("Your Plan:", current)
        print("Least Busy QPU:", backend.name)
else:
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown plan type: {current}")

# --- do other things below with backend, quantum circuit, sampler & transpilation ------
```
