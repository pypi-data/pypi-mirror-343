              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

`pipmaster` is a versatile Python library designed to simplify and automate Python package management tasks directly from your code. It provides a robust, programmatic interface to `pip`, allowing you to install, update, check, and uninstall packages, manage requirements, target different Python environments, perform vulnerability checks, and more, with both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.

**View the full documentation at [parisneo.github.io/pipmaster/](https://parisneo.github.io/pipmaster/).**

## Why pipmaster?

*   **Programmatic Control:** Manage packages within your scripts, setup routines, or automation tasks.
*   **Environment Targeting:** Install and check packages in different virtual environments, not just the current one.
*   **Rich Feature Set:** Handles specific versions, custom indexes, editable installs, requirements files, conditional installs, dry runs, and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Modern & Robust:** Uses modern standard libraries like `importlib.metadata` and `packaging` for reliable checks.
*   **Async Support:** Provides asynchronous functions for integration into async applications.
*   **Extensible:** Designed with placeholders for future support of backends like UV or Conda.

## Key Features

*   Install/upgrade single or multiple packages (`install`, `install_multiple`).
*   Install specific package versions (`install_version`).
*   Install packages only if they are missing (`install_multiple_if_not_installed`).
*   Conditionally install/update based on version specifiers (`install_if_missing`).
*   Install packages in editable mode (`install_edit`).
*   Install packages from requirements files (`install_requirements`).
*   Check if packages are installed, optionally matching version specifiers (`is_installed`, `is_version_compatible`).
*   Get installed package versions (`get_installed_version`) and details (`get_package_info`).
*   Install or update packages (`install_or_update`, `install_or_update_multiple`).
*   Uninstall single or multiple packages (`uninstall`, `uninstall_multiple`).
*   **Target specific Python environments** by providing the path to the Python executable.
*   **Dry Run mode** (`dry_run=True`) to simulate commands without making changes.
*   **Asynchronous API** (e.g., `async_install`) for non-blocking operations.
*   **Vulnerability Checking** using `pip-audit` integration (`check_vulnerabilities`).
*   Convenient module-level functions for common tasks.
*   Instantiable `PackageManager` and `AsyncPackageManager` classes for more control.

## Installation

`pipmaster` requires Python 3.8 or higher.

```bash
pip install pipmaster
```

### Optional Features

`pipmaster` offers optional features that require extra dependencies. Install them as needed:

*   **Vulnerability Auditing:** Enables the `check_vulnerabilities` function.
    ```bash
    pip install pipmaster[audit]
    ```

*   **Development Tools:** Includes tools for testing, linting, and building documentation (pytest, ruff, sphinx, etc.).
    ```bash
    pip install pipmaster[dev]
    # Or for editable install during development:
    # pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

*   **All Extras:** Install all optional dependencies at once.
    ```bash
    pip install pipmaster[all]
    # Or for editable install:
    # pip install -e .[all]
    ```

## Basic Usage

Import the library and use the module-level functions for quick tasks targeting the current Python environment:

```python
import pipmaster as pm
import asyncio # For async examples

# Install the latest version of 'requests' (or upgrade if present)
print("Installing requests...")
if pm.install("requests"):
    print("Requests installed/updated.")
else:
    print("Failed to install requests.")

# Check if 'numpy' version 1.20 or higher is installed
print("\nChecking numpy version...")
if pm.is_installed("numpy", version_specifier=">=1.20.0"):
    version = pm.get_installed_version("numpy")
    print(f"Compatible numpy version ({version}) found.")
else:
    print("Compatible numpy not found. Installing...")
    pm.install("numpy>=1.20.0") # Install with the required specifier
```

## Detailed Usage & Examples

### 1. Installation Functions

```python
# Install latest (or upgrade)
pm.install("pandas")

# Install without implicit upgrade
pm.install("matplotlib", upgrade=False)

# Force reinstall
pm.install("scipy", force_reinstall=True)

# Install from a custom index URL
pm.install("torch", index_url="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121")

# Install a specific version
pm.install_version("requests", "2.28.1")

# Install multiple packages (will upgrade by default)
pm.install_multiple(["seaborn", "plotly"])

# Install multiple from a specific index, forcing reinstall
pm.install_multiple(
    ["torchvision", "torchaudio"],
    index_url="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121",
    force_reinstall=True
)

# Install only if missing (checks presence, not version)
pm.install_multiple_if_not_installed(["python-dotenv", "tqdm"])

# Install from requirements file
# Create a dummy requirements.txt:
# with open("reqs.txt", "w") as f: f.write("colorama\ntermcolor")
pm.install_requirements("reqs.txt")

# Install local package in editable mode
# Assume 'my_local_package' exists at './my_local_package' with a setup.py or pyproject.toml
# pm.install_edit("./my_local_package") # Uncomment if you have a local package

# Conditional installation with version checking
# Install numpy>=1.21 only if it's missing OR if installed version is < 1.21
pm.install_if_missing("numpy", version_specifier=">=1.21.0")

# Install exactly version 3.10.0 of protobuf if missing or different version installed
pm.install_if_missing("protobuf", version_specifier="==3.10.0")

# Install if missing, or ensure it's updated to latest if present
pm.install_if_missing("pip", always_update=True)
```

### 2. Checking Package Status

```python
# Check if installed
if pm.is_installed("requests"):
    print("Requests is installed.")

# Check if specific version specifier is met
if pm.is_installed("packaging", version_specifier=">=21.0"):
    print("Compatible 'packaging' version installed.")

# Get installed version (returns str or None)
numpy_ver = pm.get_installed_version("numpy")
if numpy_ver:
    print(f"Installed numpy version: {numpy_ver}")
else:
    print("Numpy is not installed.")

# Explicitly check version compatibility
if pm.is_version_compatible("pip", ">=23.0"):
    print("Pip version is >= 23.0")
else:
    print("Pip version is older than 23.0")

# Get detailed package info (output of 'pip show')
info = pm.get_package_info("pipmaster") # Get info about pipmaster itself
if info:
    print("\n--- pipmaster info ---")
    print(info)
    print("----------------------\n")
```

### 3. Uninstalling Packages

```python
# Uninstall a single package (assuming 'termcolor' was installed via reqs.txt)
# print("Uninstalling termcolor...")
# pm.uninstall("termcolor")

# Uninstall multiple packages
# print("Uninstalling colorama and python-dotenv...")
# pm.uninstall_multiple(["colorama", "python-dotenv"])
```

### 4. Advanced Features

**Targeting Other Environments**

```python
# Specify the path to the python executable of another virtual environment
other_env_python = "/path/to/your/other/venv/bin/python" # Linux/macOS example
# other_env_python = "C:/path/to/your/other/venv/Scripts/python.exe" # Windows example

# Get a dedicated manager instance for that environment
# Replace with a valid path if you want to test this
# try:
#     other_pm = pm.get_pip_manager(python_executable=other_env_python)
#     print(f"\nChecking 'requests' in environment: {other_env_python}")
#     if other_pm.is_installed("requests"):
#         print("'requests' is installed in the other environment.")
#         other_pm.uninstall("requests") # Example: Uninstall from other env
#     else:
#         print("'requests' is NOT installed in the other environment.")
#         other_pm.install("requests") # Example: Install into other env
# except FileNotFoundError:
#      print(f"Skipping environment targeting test: Path not found '{other_env_python}'")

```

**Dry Run Mode**

Simulate commands without making changes.

```python
print("\n--- Dry Run Examples ---")
# Simulate installing requests
pm.install("requests", dry_run=True)

# Simulate uninstalling multiple packages
pm.uninstall_multiple(["numpy", "pandas"], dry_run=True)

# Simulate installing requirements
pm.install_requirements("reqs.txt", dry_run=True)
print("----------------------\n")
```

**Vulnerability Scanning**

Requires `pipmaster[audit]` to be installed.

```python
print("\n--- Vulnerability Check ---")
# Check the current environment (or the one targeted by a PackageManager instance)
# Note: Needs pip-audit installed in the *environment running this script*
try:
    found_vulns, report = pm.check_vulnerabilities()
    if found_vulns:
        print("WARNING: Vulnerabilities found!")
        # print(report) # Optionally print the full report
    else:
        print("No vulnerabilities found in the environment.")
except ImportError: # Or handle FileNotFoundError if pip-audit isn't installed
    print("Skipping vulnerability check: pip-audit not found. Install with 'pip install pipmaster[audit]'")
print("-------------------------\n")
```

### 5. Asynchronous Usage

Use the `async_` prefixed functions within an `async` context.

```python
async def run_async_tasks():
    print("\n--- Async Examples ---")

    # Async install
    print("Async: Installing 'aiohttp'...")
    success = await pm.async_install("aiohttp")
    if success:
        print("Async: aiohttp installed.")
    else:
        print("Async: Failed to install aiohttp.")

    # Async check vulnerabilities
    print("Async: Checking vulnerabilities...")
    try:
         # Note: check_vulnerabilities itself isn't fully async internally yet,
         # but the wrapper uses asyncio.create_subprocess_shell
        found, report = await pm.async_check_vulnerabilities()
        if found:
             print("Async: WARNING: Vulnerabilities found!")
        else:
             print("Async: No vulnerabilities found.")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Async: Vulnerability check failed: {e}")

    # Add more async examples as needed (e.g., async_uninstall)
    print("--------------------\n")

# To run the async functions:
# asyncio.run(run_async_tasks()) # Uncomment to run
```

### 6. Using the `PackageManager` Class Directly

For more control, especially when repeatedly targeting a specific environment or using custom pip commands:

```python
from pipmaster import PackageManager

# Manager for the current environment (same as module functions)
default_pm = PackageManager()
default_pm.install("rich")

# Manager targeting a specific environment
# other_env_python = "/path/to/other/venv/bin/python"
# try:
#     other_pm = PackageManager(python_executable=other_env_python)
#     other_pm.install("requests") # Install requests in the other environment
#     print(f"Version in other env: {other_pm.get_installed_version('requests')}")
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print(f"Path not found, cannot create manager for: {other_env_python}")


# Advanced: Custom base command (Use with caution!)
# custom_pm = PackageManager(pip_command_base=["/path/to/custom/pip", "--no-cache-dir"])
# custom_pm.install("somepackage")
```
### 7. Ensuring Multiple Package Requirements (`ensure_packages`)

For managing a set of required packages with specific versions efficiently, use `ensure_packages`. It checks all requirements and performs a single installation/update command for only those packages that need it.

```python
# Define your project's requirements
my_requirements = {
    "requests": ">=2.25.0,<3.0.0",
    "pandas": ">=1.3.0",
    "numpy": None, # Install latest if missing, otherwise accept any version
    "torch": "==1.13.1" # Example: exact version
}

print("\n--- Ensuring Project Requirements ---")
# This will check all packages and install/update if needed
success = pm.ensure_packages(my_requirements)

if success:
    print("All project requirements are met.")
else:
    print("Failed to ensure all project requirements.")

# You can also use it with index_url, extra_args, dry_run
# pm.ensure_packages(
#     my_requirements,
#     index_url="https://custom-index.com",
#     extra_args=["--no-cache-dir"],
#     dry_run=True
# )
print("-----------------------------------\n")
```

**How it Works:**

1.  It takes the `requirements` dictionary.
2.  It iterates through each `package`, `specifier` pair.
3.  It uses `self.is_installed(package, version_specifier=specifier)` to check if the current state meets the requirement.
4.  If a requirement is *not* met, it formats the package string (e.g., `"package>=1.2.3"` or just `"package"`) and adds it to a list `packages_to_process`.
5.  If `packages_to_process` is not empty after checking all requirements, it calls `self.install_multiple(packages=packages_to_process, upgrade=True, ...)` once to handle all necessary installations/updates efficiently.
6.  It returns `True` if everything was okay initially or the `install_multiple` call succeeded, `False` otherwise.


## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

A dedicated command-line interface for `pipmaster` is planned for future development, allowing easy environment creation and package management from the terminal using different backends (pip, uv, conda).
