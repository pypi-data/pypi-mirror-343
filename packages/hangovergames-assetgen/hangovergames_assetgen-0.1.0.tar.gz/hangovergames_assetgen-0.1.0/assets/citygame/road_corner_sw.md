```
Create a clean top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the stated pixel dimensions so every asset aligns perfectly with the city-grid scale; use crisp, slightly stylized flat-shaded colors with subtle texture noise for asphalt or building roofs, soft antialiased edges, and a gentle overhead noon light that casts minimal shadow directly beneath the object; isolate exactly one subject per file with no extra elements, ensure all strokes and highlights remain inside the canvas to avoid bleed, and keep the style consistent across roads, buildings, vehicles and decorative tiles so they can be dynamically layered without seams or palette clashes. A counter-clockwise bend turning north-to-west with the same dashed center arc, edge lines and subtle grit, completing the full set of corner assets for intersection construction.
