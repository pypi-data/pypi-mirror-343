Create a clean top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the stated pixel dimensions so every asset aligns perfectly with the city-grid scale; use crisp, slightly stylized flat-shaded colors with subtle texture noise for asphalt or building roofs, soft antialiased edges, and a gentle overhead noon light that casts minimal shadow directly beneath the object; isolate exactly one subject per file with no extra elements, ensure all strokes and highlights remain inside the canvas to avoid bleed, and keep the style consistent across roads, buildings, vehicles and decorative tiles so they can be dynamically layered without seams or palette clashes. A 256×256-pixel ninety-degree bend that carries traffic from south to east, showing smoothly curved dashed center markings, lane-edge stripes that widen toward the outer radius, tiny gutter drains at the outer curb and micro-chips in the asphalt, all rendered top-down with antialiased curves and transparent outside corners so the piece nests flush against adjacent straight tiles.
