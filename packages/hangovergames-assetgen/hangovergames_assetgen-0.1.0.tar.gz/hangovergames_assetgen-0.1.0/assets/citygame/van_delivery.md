Create a clean top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the stated pixel dimensions so every asset aligns perfectly with the city-grid scale; use crisp, slightly stylized flat-shaded colors with subtle texture noise for asphalt or building roofs, soft antialiased edges, and a gentle overhead noon light that casts minimal shadow directly beneath the object; isolate exactly one subject per file with no extra elements, ensure all strokes and highlights remain inside the canvas to avoid bleed, and keep the style consistent across roads, buildings, vehicles and decorative tiles so they can be dynamically layered without seams or palette clashes. A 112Ã—56-pixel box van sprite in neutral white with sliding side door outline, twin rear doors, gray bumpers and small roof clearance marker lights, drawn from the same strict top-down angle and delivered with transparent backdrop.
