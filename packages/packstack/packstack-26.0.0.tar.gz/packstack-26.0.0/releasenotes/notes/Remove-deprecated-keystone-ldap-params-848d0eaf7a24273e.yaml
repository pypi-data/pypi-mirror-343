deprecations:

    The CONFIG_KEYSTONE_LDAP_USER_ALLOW_* and
    CONFIG_KEYSTONE_LDAP_GROUP_ALLOW_* parameters have been removed from the
    answer file. Their corresponding options were removed from Keystone long
    ago, and they are no longer valid in puppet-keystone since the Rocky
    release.
