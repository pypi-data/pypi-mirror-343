# Nerd Font icons for python

## Installation

```{.sh}
pip install nerdfont
```

## Usage

```{.py}
import nerdfont as nf

print(nf.icons['fa-thumbs_up']) # Supports both without prefix
>>> 
print(nf.icons['nf-fa-thumbs_up']) # And with `nf-` prefix
>>> 
```

All non-removed icons that are available on in the [Nerd Fonts
cheat-sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) should be included in this
package.

## Build

```{.sh}
# Run the generate script to download nerd font's character mapping
# and generate a python-formatted version of it.  Save this file as icons.py
# in the nerdfont subdirectory.  Note that this pulls the latest revision
# on the master branch.  You can easily change this  with the --revision flag.

rm -rf build dist nerdfont.egg-info && \
python3 ./nerdfont/generate.py > ./nerdfont/icons.py && \
python3 -m build && \
python3 -m pip install . && \
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```
