iPOPO is a Python-based Service-Oriented Component Model (SOCM) based on Pelix,
a dynamic service platform.
They are inspired by two popular Java technologies for the development of
long-lived applications: the
[iPOJO](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616112915/http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html)
component model and the [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/) Service Platform.
iPOPO enables the conception of long-running and modular IT services.
The iPOJO component model was designed by Cl√©ment Escoffier in his
[PhD Thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00347935/document) (in French),
while the iPOPO component model was designed by Thomas Calmant in his
[PhD Thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-01254286/file/CALMANT_2015_archivage.pdf)
(in French).

This documentation is divided into three main parts.
The [quickstart](./quickstart.md) will guide you to install iPOPO and write your
first components.
The [reference cards](./refcards/index.md) details the various concepts of iPOPO.
Finally, the [tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) explain how to use the various
built-in services of iPOPO.
You can also take a look at the slides of the
[iPOPO tutorial](https://github.com/tcalmant/ipopo-tutorials/releases)
to have a quick overview of iPOPO.
