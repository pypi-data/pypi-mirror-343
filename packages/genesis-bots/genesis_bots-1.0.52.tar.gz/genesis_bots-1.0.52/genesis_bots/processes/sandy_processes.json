From a security point of view, it is beneficial if SAML-based SSO is used more than any other method when logging into the Snowflake UI. The ultimate goal is to establish if SAML-based SSO is in use and, if so, how much. This process may be called asking only for the simple yes or no answer, or it may be called asking for the larger set of recommendations. If no clarification is made when it's called, then perform both.\n\n1. **Execute SQL Query**\n   - Run the following SQL query against the Snowflake account to investigate SAML-based SSO usage:\n     ```sql\n     WITH total_users AS (\n         SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT USER_NAME) AS total_user_count\n         FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOGIN_HISTORY\n         WHERE REPORTED_CLIENT_TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_UI'\n         AND EVENT_TIMESTAMP > dateadd('months',-6, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\n     ),\n     saml2_users AS (\n         SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT USER_NAME) AS saml2_user_count\n         FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOGIN_HISTORY\n         WHERE REPORTED_CLIENT_TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_UI'\n         AND FIRST_AUTHENTICATION_FACTOR = 'SAML2_ASSERTION'\n         AND EVENT_TIMESTAMP > dateadd('months',-6, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\n     )\n     SELECT \n         saml2_user_count,\n         total_user_count,\n         (saml2_user_count / total_user_count) * 100 AS percentage\n     FROM \n         total_users, \n         saml2_users;\n     ```\n\n2. **Retrieve Results**\n   - Retrieve the resulting data, including:\n     - The count of users using SAML-based SSO.\n     - The total user count.\n     - The percentage of users using SAML-based SSO.\n\n3. **Interpret Results**\n   - Interpret the percentage column from the SQL results based on the following guidelines:\n     - If at least 10% of users are using SAML, state that \"SAML is in use.\"\n     - If around half of users are using SAML, state that \"SAML is used broadly but not yet fully adopted.\"\n     - If a supermajority of users are using SAML, state that \"There is good adoption of SAML.\"\n     - If more than 90% of users are using SAML, state that \"SAML is near fully adopted with some work to do on edge cases.\"\n     - If less than 5% of users are using SAML, state that \"SAML is not in use.\"\n\n4. **Provide Yes/No Answer**\n   - Provide a simple yes or no answer regarding the use of SAML based on the interpretation.\n\n5. **Assess Security and Provide Recommendations**\n   - Assess the level of SAML usage from a security point of view.\n   - Provide recommendations for improving SAML adoption and enhancing security if needed.",

      "PROCESS_INSTRUCTIONS": "**INTENTIONS**\nYou want to generate a SQL statement based on the SQL below using the steps to gather information to fill in the details of the SQL. You should not add any additional attributes to the SQL, but you may remove attributes (such as removing the password if the steps determine it should not be there). In the end, you will have a valid SQL statement to create a user which you will then run on behalf of the person you are talking to. The SQL template follows, and the step by step process is after that.\n\n```sql\nCREATE USER <NAMEOFUSER> \n    PASSWORD = <PASSWORD>\n    MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE -- only set if there is a password\n    LOGIN_NAME = <user email address specified by person>\n    EMAIL = <user email address specified by person>\n    DISPLAY_NAME = <NAMEOFUSER>\n    DEFAULT_ROLE = \"PUBLIC\" \n    DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES = ('ALL')  -- if they are in use at all\n    FIRST_NAME = <FIRST_NAME>\n    MIDDLE_NAME = <MIDDLE_NAME>\n    LAST_NAME = <LAST_NAME>\n    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = <warehouse specified by person>\n    DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = <database only or database and schema specified by person>\n    TYPE = PERSON\n    COMMENT = 'Created using the Genesis bots on <DATE>'\n    ;\n```\n\n1. **Gather Basic Information:**\n   - **User Name**: \"What should the name of the Snowflake user be?\" This answer will be used as `<NAMEOFUSER>` in the SQL.\n   - **Email**: \"What is the email of the user?\" This answer will be used both as `EMAIL` and `LOGIN_NAME` in the SQL. In the final SQL do not forget to include this one value as both attributes of the user you are creating.\n   - **First Name**: \"What is the first name of the user?\" This answer will be used as `<FIRST_NAME>` in the SQL.\n   - **Middle Name**: \"What is the middle name of the user?\" This answer will be used as `<MIDDLE_NAME>` in the SQL. If there is no middle name, this part will be omitted from the SQL.\n   - **Last Name**: \"What is the last name of the user?\" This answer will be used as `<LAST_NAME>` in the SQL.\n\n2. **Determine if a Password Should be Set:**\n   - Run the process named \"Investigating and determining SAML adoption\" with process_id `sandy10-fixed_123abc_aX0qhg` to determine if SAML-based SSO is in use, and call the process in concise mode so it should only give you the result which you can use as a criteria for the next two decisions.\n   - If based on the output of the process named \"Investigating and determining SAML adoption\" you decide that SAML-based SSO is in use, advise the person not to set a password because using SAML based SSO is much more secure. If the person says they wish to set a password regardless of that advice, proceed to the next step. If they say not to set a password then skip the next step and move on to the one after that.\n   - If based on the output of the process named \"Investigating and determining SAML adoption\" you decide that SAML-based SSO is not in use, then silently move on to the next step.\n\n3. **Generate a Password (if needed):**\n   - Run the process named \"Make a secure random password\" to generate a password, and call the process in concise mode so it should only give you the result which you can use as the value of `<PASSWORD>` for the rest of this process.\n   - Use the generated password as the `<PASSWORD>` value in the SQL include both `MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD` and `PASSWORD` in the final SQL.\n\n4. **Determine if Secondary Roles are in Use:**\n   - Run the process named \"Determining secondary roles use\" with process_id `sandy-v0.1_secondary_roles_use_123abc_8iwyVb` to determine if secondary roles are in use, and when you call the process tell it to run in the background, meaning not sharing its outputs and only give you the result which you can use as a criteria for the next decisions.\n   - If secondary roles are in use, advise setting `DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES = ('ALL')` because that is the current practice and let the user know that reason.\n   - Follow the person's directive on whether to set `DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES = ('ALL')` or omit it in the final SQL.\n\n5. **Gather Remaining Values:**\n   - Inform the person that `DEFAULT_ROLE = \"PUBLIC\"` will be set unless they wish to set a different `DEFAULT_ROLE` or omit `DEFAULT_ROLE` altogether. Follow their directive on this.\n   - Ask if they have any value to set for `DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE`. Omit `DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE` from the final SQL if they do not provide a value.\n   - Ask if they have any value to set for `DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`. Omit `DEFAULT_NAMESPACE` from the final SQL if they do not provide a value.\n\n6. **Set Final Attributes:**\n   - Inform the person that `TYPE = PERSON` will be set because we are only assisting with `PERSON` type user objects in Snowflake right now.\n   - Inform the person that the `COMMENT` will be set to `Created using the Genesis bots on <DATE>`, where `<DATE>` will be replaced with the current date and time.\n   - Use the ProcessScheduler tool to get the current date and time for the `<DATE>` field in the comment section of the SQL.\n   - Integrate the obtained date and time into the SQL comment field.\n\n7. **Integrate and Confirm:**\n   - Integrate all the gathered information into the SQL template provided.\n   - Show the constructed SQL to the person and have them confirm it looks correct.\n   - Ask the person if you should proceed to create the user.\n\n8. **Execute and Report:**\n   - Run the `CREATE USER` statement in the form confirmed by the person.\n   - Report the results back to the person.",
