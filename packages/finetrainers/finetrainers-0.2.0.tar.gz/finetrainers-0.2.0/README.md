## Quickstart

Clone the repository and make sure the requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt` and install `diffusers` from source by `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers`. The requirements specify `diffusers>=0.32.1`, but it is always recommended to use the `main` branch of Diffusers for the latest features and bugfixes. Note that the `main` branch for `finetrainers` is also the development branch, and stable support should be expected from the release tags.

Checkout to the latest stable release tag:

```bash
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout tags/v0.1.0
```

Follow the instructions mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/finetrainers/tree/v0.2.0-release) for the latest stable release.

#### Using the main branch

To get started quickly with example training scripts on the main development branch, refer to the following:
- [LTX-Video Pika Effects Crush](./examples/training/sft/ltx_video/crush_smol_lora/)
- [CogVideoX Pika Effects Crush](./examples/training/sft/cogvideox/crush_smol_lora/)
- [Wan T2V Pika Effects Crush](./examples/training/sft/wan/crush_smol_lora/)

The following are some simple datasets/HF orgs with good datasets to test training with quickly:
- [Disney Video Generation Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Wild-Heart/Disney-VideoGeneration-Dataset)
- [bigdatapw Video Dataset Collection](https://huggingface.co/bigdata-pw)
- [Finetrainers HF Dataset Collection](https://huggingface.co/finetrainers)

Please checkout [`docs/models`](./docs/models/) and [`examples/training`](./examples/training/) to learn more about supported models for training & example reproducible training launch scripts. For a full list of arguments that can be set for training, refer to [`docs/args`](./docs/args.md).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> It is recommended to use Pytorch 2.5.1 or above for training. Previous versions can lead to completely black videos, OOM errors, or other issues and are not tested. For fully reproducible training, please use the same environment as mentioned in [environment.md](./docs/environment.md).

## Features

- DDP, FSDP-2 & HSDP support for all models
- LoRA and full-rank finetuning; Conditional Control training

- Memory-efficient precomputation support with/without on-the-fly precomputation for large scale datasets
- Standardized model specification format for training arbitrary models

## Support Matrix

The following trainers are currently supported:

- [SFT Trainer](./docs/trainer/sft_trainer.md)
- [Control Trainer](./docs/trainer/control_trainer.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The following numbers were obtained from the [release branch](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/finetrainers/tree/v0.0.1). The `main` branch is unstable at the moment and may use higher memory.
