# ollmcp

A command-line interface for connecting to MCP servers using Ollama.

## Installation

```
pip install ollmcp
```

## Usage

```
ollmcp [options]
```

## Description

This is a lightweight package that provides the `ollmcp` command-line interface. It's a convenience wrapper around the main [`mcp-client-for-ollama`](https://github.com/jonigl/mcp-client-for-ollama) package.

The actual implementation is contained in the main package. This package simply provides a more convenient and shorter name for installing the CLI tool.
