`exactextract` provides a fast and accurate algorithm for summarizing values in the portion of a raster dataset that is covered by a polygon, often referred to as **zonal statistics**. Implemented in C++, it is available through a command line interface as well as packages for [Python](https://pypi.org/project/exactextract/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exactextractr). More information is available in the [project documentation](https://isciences.github.io/exactextract).
