**Open Codex** is a fully open-source command-line AI assistant inspired by OpenAI Codex, supporting local language models like `phi-4-mini`.

No API key is required. Everything runs locally.

Supports:
- **One-shot mode**: `open-codex "list all folders"` -> returns shell command
- 🧠 Local-only execution using supported OS models (currently `phi-4-mini`)

---
## ✨ Features

- Natural Language to Shell Command (via local models)
- Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (Python-based)
- Confirmation before execution
- Add to clipboard / abort / execute prompt
- One-shot interaction mode (interactive and function-calling coming soon)
- Colored terminal output for better readability

---

## 🧱 Future Plans

- Interactive, context aware mode
- Fancy TUI with `textual` or `rich`
- Add support for additional OSS Models
- Full interactive chat mode
- Function-calling support
- Voice input via Whisper
- Command history and undo
- Plugin system for workflows
