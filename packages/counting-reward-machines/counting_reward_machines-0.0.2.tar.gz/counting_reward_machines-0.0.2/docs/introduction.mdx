# Counting Reward Machines
Counting Reward Machines (CRMs) are a powerful formalism for specifying reward functions in reinforcement learning tasks. They extend reward machines by replacing finite-state machines with counter automata, producing a more expressive (Turing-complete) framework for reward specification in RL. This increased expressiveness allows CRMs to define any task that can be represented as a well-defined algorithm, while also yielding more compact representations than standard reward machines.

## What are CRMs?

CRMs combine:
- **Finite State Machines**: To track progress through sequences
- **Counting Mechanisms (Counter Variables)**: To act as an extended automaton memory 
- **Reward Functions**: To provide learning signal to RL agents 

This makes them ideal for tasks where rewards depend on:
- Completing sequences of actions in order
- Achieving goals multiple times
- Meeting complex temporal specifications

## Key Features

- **Pure Python Implementation**: Built using standard Python libraries
- **Flexible Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing RL environments
- **Example Environments**: Includes example environments to get started
- **Cross-Product Construction**: Automated construction of cross-product MDPs
