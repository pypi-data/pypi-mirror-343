# SAD2XS

## The (Unofficial) Strategic Accelerator Design (SAD) to Xsuite Converter
SAD2XS is a lattice conversion tool, taking a lattice path to a .sad lattice 
file and outputing an Xtrack Line object.

## Project status
This project is a **work in progress**.
Tests have been sucessfully performed against FCC-ee.
Tests against SuperKEKB have known issues due to the physics model differences between SAD and Xsuite.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Written by John Salvesen and Giovanni Iadarola

With thanks to Katsunobu Oide for their discussion and expertise on SAD

With thanks to Ghislain Roy for his support in testing

## Known Issues

### Solenoid Import
No import of solenoid slices. Currently these slices are ignored.
Only the DZ geometric correction at the BOUND edge of the solenoid is imported.
No import of the other corrections (DX, DY, CHI1, CHI2, CHI3)

### Fringe Import
No import of maxwellian fringes features in SAD.
Not currently available in Xsuite
