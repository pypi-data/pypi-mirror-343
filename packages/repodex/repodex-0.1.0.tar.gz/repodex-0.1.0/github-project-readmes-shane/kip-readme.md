# Knowledge Infrastructure Protocol (KIP)

![svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/master/svg/brain.svg)

A next-generation protocol for knowledge management and distribution, enabling living, evolving knowledge structures through a dynamic infrastructure.

## Overview

The Knowledge Infrastructure Protocol (KIP) ecosystem represents a paradigm shift in how we manage and distribute knowledge. Unlike traditional web protocols or Web3's immutable approach, KIP enables dynamic, evolving knowledge while maintaining verifiable attribution and trust.

## Core Components

### KIP (Knowledge Infrastructure Protocol)

- Protocol for knowledge transmission and management
- Dynamic state management and synchronization
- Knowledge-first architecture with graph-based relationships
- Addressing schema: `kip://[provider]/[knowledge-space]/[knowledge-id]`

### OmniBase

- Knowledge browser application
- Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) management
- Knowledge Space navigation
- Local-first architecture with AI integration

### KIPnet

- ISP/Telco-based knowledge infrastructure
- Knowledge transmission network
- Edge processing and caching
- Global knowledge distribution system

### EAR (Entity Attribution Record)

- Immutable attribution layer
- Creation and ownership verification
- Rights management system
- Smart contract integration

## Documentation

Our documentation is built using MkDocs with the Material theme. The documentation structure is organized into:

- **Core Concepts**: Detailed specifications and architectural designs
- **Philosophy & Analysis**: Theoretical foundations and comparative analysis
- **Declarations**: Original conception and rights documentation

### Viewing the Documentation

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

2. Serve locally:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

3. Build static site:

    ```bash
    mkdocs build
    ```

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Knowledge**: Support for evolving, living knowledge
- **Trust Model**: Verification through expertise and peer review
- **State Management**: Progressive understanding with history tracking
- **Graph Integration**: Rich relationships between knowledge entities
- **Local-First**: Edge processing and offline capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Protocol Stack

```txt
Application Layer:    OmniBase (Client Knowledge Browser)
Service Layer:        KIP Services (ISP Knowledge Services)
Protocol Layer:       KIP (Knowledge Infrastructure Protocol)
Network Layer:        Existing Internet Infrastructure
```

### Blockchain Integration

- Primary Layer: Solana (for performance and cost-efficiency)
- Secondary Layer: Ethereum (for critical record anchoring)
- Smart Contract Support: Rights management and attribution

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for certain tools)
- Rust (for core components)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up development environment
4. Run local documentation server
