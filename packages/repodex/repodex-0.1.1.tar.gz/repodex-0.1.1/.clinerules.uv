# UV-Native Workflow Enforcement Rules

This file defines strict enforcement rules for the UV-native workflow in the RepoDex project.

## Prohibited Commands and Patterns

The following commands and patterns are strictly prohibited in this project:

1. Any command containing the string "pip" (e.g., `pip install`, `uv pip install`, etc.)
2. Any reference to pip in documentation, comments, or code
3. Any tools or libraries that internally use pip

## Required Commands

The following UV-native commands must be used for all Python package operations:

1. `uv install` - For installing packages
2. `uv tool install` - For installing development tools
3. `uv sync` - For syncing virtual environments
4. `uv build` - For building packages
5. `uv publish` - For publishing packages

## Enforcement Mechanisms

1. All pull requests will be automatically checked for compliance with these rules
2. Any violation will result in automatic rejection
3. Code reviews must verify compliance with these rules
4. CI/CD pipelines will enforce these rules

## Rationale

UV provides a modern, faster, and more reliable Python packaging experience. By standardizing on UV-native commands, we ensure consistent behavior across all development environments and eliminate the issues associated with pip-based workflows.

## Exceptions

There are **NO EXCEPTIONS** to these rules. The prohibition against pip is absolute and non-negotiable.
