## Project Description

>(aka; What are you trying to achieve?):

```txt
This project uses best practices to help you rapidly scaffold out an app to its basic working prototype.

It's language agnostic and is designed only for app development - not office work or networking tasks etc.

NOTE: The alpha version of this project is to have staff see if they prefer the outcome of the "Alpha" or "Release" version.

This ALPHA version is written in explicit and verbose markdown.
