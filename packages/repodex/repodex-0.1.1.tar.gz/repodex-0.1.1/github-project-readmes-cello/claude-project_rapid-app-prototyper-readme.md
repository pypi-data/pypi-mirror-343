## Project Description

>(aka; What are you trying to achieve?):

```txt
This project uses best practices to help you rapidly scaffold out an app to its basic working prototype.

It's language agnostic and is designed only for app development - not office work or networking tasks etc.

NOTE: The Release version of this project is to have staff see if they prefer the outcome of the "Alpha" or "Release" version.

This Release version is written in suggestive and concise xml format whereas the Alpha version is written in a more explicit and verbose markdown format
