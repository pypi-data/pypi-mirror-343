# Progress: RepoDex

## Current Status (as of 2025-04-25 ~01:26 NZT)

The project has successfully transitioned its core tooling from a mix of Python and shell scripts to a pure Python implementation located in the `tools/` directory. Foundational project configuration (`pyproject.toml`) and documentation standards (`.clinerules`, Memory Bank) have been established.

## What Works

1. **Repository Fetching & Indexing:**
    - `tools/gh_repo_fetch_index_shane.py`: Successfully fetches personal repositories (public & private, excluding forks), downloads READMEs, and generates `github-project-readmes-shane/README.md` and `repositories.csv`.
    - `tools/gh_repo_fetch_index_cello.py`: Successfully fetches Cello Communications repositories authored by `shaneholloman` using GraphQL optimization, downloads READMEs, and generates `github-project-readmes-cello/README.md` and `repositories.csv`.
2. **Release Management:**
    - `tools/gh_repo_release_initial_*.py`: Can identify untagged repositories (personal or Cello-authored) and create initial `v0.1.0` releases.
    - `tools/gh_repo_release_latest_*.py`: Can identify the latest semantic version tag for repositories (personal or Cello-authored) and create a corresponding release if one doesn't exist. Requires the `packaging` library.
3. **README Batch Updates:**
    - `tools/gh_repo_update_readmes.py`: Can read a list of repositories from a CSV file and update their remote READMEs using corresponding local files.
4. **Secret Management:**
    - `tools/gh_repo_setup_secret.py`: Can securely add a GitHub PAT as a repository secret.
5. **Automation:**
    - The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update_github_readmes.yml`) is configured to run the fetcher scripts automatically. (Requires `GH_PAT` secret to be set).
6. **Configuration & Standards:**
    - `pyproject.toml` defines Python 3.10+ requirement and basic metadata.
    - `.clinerules` defines coding standards (Ruff), development workflow (Terminal Testing First), output preferences (no emojis, bracket indicators), and documentation rules.

## What's Left to Build / Improve

1. **Testing:** No automated tests currently exist for the Python tools. Unit and integration tests should be added to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
2. **Error Handling:** While basic error handling exists (checking `subprocess` results), it could be made more robust, especially around API interactions (e.g., more specific rate limit handling, retries).
3. **Configuration Management:**
    - Consider centralizing configuration currently defined as constants within scripts (e.g., usernames, org names, output dirs) into `pyproject.toml` or a separate config file.
    - Decide whether to move Ruff config from `.clinerules` to `pyproject.toml`.
4. **Dependency Management:** Formalize the `packaging` dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
5. **Type Hint Review:** Re-evaluate the use of `typing.Union` vs. `|` now that Python 3.10 is the target. The `|` syntax is generally preferred for 3.10+.
6. **Flexibility:** The `gh_repo_update_readmes.py` tool currently defaults to the `shane` CSV/directory; making target selection (shane vs. cello) more explicit via arguments could be beneficial.

## Known Issues

- None explicitly identified during the recent refactoring, but the lack of automated tests means potential regressions could exist or arise easily.
- The reliance on external `gh` CLI means changes in `gh` output formatting could break the scripts if parsing is too brittle (though current parsing seems robust, relying on JSON output where possible).
