# Active Context: RepoDex

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus has been on consolidating the project's tooling into Python and establishing foundational project configuration and documentation standards, including the creation of this Memory Bank.

## Recent Changes (as of 2025-04-25 ~01:25 NZT)

1. **Shell Script Removal/Conversion:**
    - Deleted redundant shell scripts: `scripts/gh_find_repos_authored_simple.sh`, `scripts/gh_find_repos_authored.sh`.
    - Converted `scripts/gh_update_readmes_batch.sh` to `tools/gh_repo_update_readmes.py`, adding dynamic repository list loading from CSV.
    - Converted `scripts/gh_setup_secret_pat.sh` to `tools/gh_repo_setup_secret.py`.
    - Removed the `scripts/` directory.
2. **Python Version Standardization:**
    - Established Python 3.10+ as the minimum required version via `pyproject.toml`.
    - Updated Ruff `target-version` in `.clinerules` to `py310`.
    - Updated `README.md` to reflect the Python 3.10+ requirement.
    - Corrected type hint syntax in Python tools (`typing.Union` instead of `|`) where necessary for compatibility checks, although the project now officially targets 3.10 allowing `|`. _Self-correction: The project now targets 3.10, so the `|` syntax is valid and preferred. The `typing.Union` was used to resolve specific linter errors during the transition but could potentially be reverted back to `|` now that the target version is updated._
3. **Project Configuration:**
    - Created `pyproject.toml` with basic project metadata, Python requirement, author details, and project URL.
4. **Documentation Updates:**
    - Updated `README.md`, `docs/github-actions.md`, `docs/optimization.md`, and `docs/readme_management.md` to reflect the removal of shell scripts and the introduction/usage of the new Python tools.
5. **Memory Bank Creation:**
    - Initiated the Memory Bank by creating `projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and this `activeContext.md` file, adhering to `.clinerules` formatting.

## Next Steps

1. **Create `memory-bank/progress.md`:** Document the current status, what works, what's left, and any known issues.
2. **Review Type Hint Syntax:** Revisit the Python tools (`gh_repo_update_readmes.py`, `gh_repo_setup_secret.py`, and potentially others if they were modified similarly) to confirm if `typing.Union` should be reverted to the `|` syntax now that Python 3.10 is the official target.
3. **Ruff Configuration Location:** Consider migrating the Ruff configuration from `.clinerules` into `pyproject.toml` under the `[tool.ruff]` section for standard project structure, while ensuring `.clinerules` still documents the _requirement_ to use Ruff.
4. **Dependency Management:** Formalize dependencies (like `packaging`) in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.dependencies]`.
5. **Testing:** Implement automated tests for the Python tools.
