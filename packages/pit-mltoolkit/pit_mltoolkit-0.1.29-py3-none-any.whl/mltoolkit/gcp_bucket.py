class GCPBucket():

    """
    A class for handling various operations within **Google Cloud**.

    ## Attributes:
    - **project_id** (`str`): The unique identifier for your Google Cloud project.
    - **location** (`str`): The region where your project is located (e.g., `europe-west1`).
    - **bucket_name** (`str`): The name of the bucket you want to work in

    ## Methods:
    - **Buckets**(`bucket_name`): Handles all operations related to Google Cloud Storage buckets.

    ## Example Usage:

    ```python

    bucket_tool = gcpBuckets(project_id='my-project',
              location='europe-west1')

    ```
    
    ## Notes:
    - Replace `'my-project'` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

            Uploads a local file to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.

            ## Parameters:
            - **file_path** (`str`): The local path to the file you want to upload.
            - **destination_blob** (`str`): The destination path (including the blob name) in the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

            ## Notes:
            - Ensure the file at `file_path` exists before attempting to upload.
            - The `destination_blob` should include the file name and any folder structure in the bucket.
            - This function assumes that the `Buckets` class has already been initialized and the client is properly authenticated.
            - In case of failure, an exception is raised and the error message will be printed.

        Creates a folder in a Google Cloud Storage bucket by simulating a directory.

        Google Cloud Storage does not have a true hierarchical filesystem.
        Instead, "folders" are represented by blob names that end with a slash.

        ## Parameters:
        - **folder_path** (`str`): The folder path to create in the bucket. 
        Typically, this should end with a slash (e.g., 'new_folder/' or 'folder/subfolder/').

        - **bucket_name** (`str`): The desired name for the new bucket.
