# brighteon.com support for yt-dlp

* support for un-nested channels and categories
* live stream support for brighteon.tv was removed since the service is inoperable

## release notes

**Broken formats:** Some MPD manifests cannot be parsed by yt-dlp. They will be
skipped with a warning until the issue is resolved.

## installation

You can install ytdlp-brighteon via pip:

* Use [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp):

  `python3 -m pip install --upgrade ytdlp-brighteon`
* Install from GitHub branch:

  `python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/flashdagger/ytdlp-plugins/archive/refs/heads/brighteon.zip`

Note that on some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`

## example: show the 20 recent titles from channel

`python3 -m yt_dlp -e --flat-playlist --playlist-items :20 https://www.brighteon.com/channels/brighteontv`

## yt-dlp

[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is a [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) fork based on the now
inactive [youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc). The main focus of this project is adding new features
and patches while also keeping up to date with the original project

Note that **all** plugins are imported even if not invoked, and that **there are no checks** performed on plugin code.
Use plugins at your own risk and only if you trust the code
