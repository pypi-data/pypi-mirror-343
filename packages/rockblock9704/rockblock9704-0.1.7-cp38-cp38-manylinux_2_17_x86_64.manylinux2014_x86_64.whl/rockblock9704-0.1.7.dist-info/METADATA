- A RockBLOCK 9704

Installation

The RockBLOCK 9704 library can be installed from PyPI::

Connecting to your RockBLOCK
============================

Once your rockBLOCK has been connected to your device via USB you will need to find its local address.

Linux / macOS
-------------

List all local devices::

    ls /dev/tty*

The name will vary depending on machine but will generally include USB in the name (e.g. ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` or ``/dev/tty.usbserial-FTH9I1S5``)

List COM devices::

    mode

When connected to my machine the port was ``COM6`` but this will vary, it can be helpful to run the command before connecting to see what port becomes active.

Begin the Serial Connection
---------------------------

Once you have the address of your device, create an instance of RockBlock9704 and call the begin method::

    from rockblock9704 import RockBlock9704

    rb = RockBlock9704()
    rb.begin(<device address>)
