This file is part of pyprofilerai, a Python package that combines profiling 
with AI-based performance optimization suggestions.

Description:
This file implements the core functionality of the pyprofilerai package, which 
provides profiling of Python code and suggests optimizations based on AI analysis.

Based on Python's cProfile module for performance analysis and utilizes Google Gemini.
