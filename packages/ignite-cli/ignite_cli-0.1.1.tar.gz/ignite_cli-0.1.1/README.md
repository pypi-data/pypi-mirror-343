# IgniteOps CLI

A fast, extensible command-line interface to interact with the IgniteOps API, similar to the AWS CLI.

```bash
# install in editable mode for development
pip install -e .

# usage
ignite --help
```

The CLI auto-generates commands from the public OpenAPI spec (`https://api.igniteops.io/openapi.json`).
