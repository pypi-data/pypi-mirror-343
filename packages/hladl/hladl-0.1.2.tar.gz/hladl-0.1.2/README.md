# hladl
### (HLA downloader)
#### JH @ MGH, 2025

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hladl?color=%239467bd)](https://pypi.org/project/hladl/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This is a simple CLI to make grabbing specific HLA allele sequences easier. It aims to be similar to [`hladownload`](https://github.com/ramonamerong/hladownload/) but without the more advanced features that offers (although that script appears to be out of action due to `Biopython` version changes since its last update).

Effectively, this script will spit out a cDNA nucleotide or protein amino acid sequence, given an allele identifier and a number of digits resolution. Sequences are grabbed from [the IPD-IMGT/HLA Github repo](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA) (as [is available through the EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/)) and stored locally in a gzippd json, allowing them to be output without a need for later internet connectivity.


### Installation

`hladl` was made with `poetry` and `typer`. It can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install hladl
```

### Usage

Sequences can be downloaded to the installed data directory using `hladl init`. Users specify the *s*equence type (nucleotide, protein, or both) with the `-s` flag, and the HLA allele digit resolution (i.e. 2, 4, 6, or 8 digit, being HLA-X*22:44:66:88) wit the `-d` flag like so:

```bash
# Download nucleotide (cDNA) sequences for 4 digit alleles
hladl init -s nuc -d 4
 
# Download protein (AA) sequences for 2 digit alleles
hladl init -s prot -d 2
```

Sequences can then be output to stdout using the `seq` command:
```bash
hladl seq -a DRA*01:01
hladl seq -a A*02 -s prot -d 2
```

Class I MHC protein sequences can also be automatically trimmed to remove leader and transmembrane/intracellular domains, yielding the extracellular domain, by specifying this in the mode option:

```bash
hladl seq -a A*02:01 -m ecd -s prot
```

Users can also instead choose to produce a FASTA file of the designated allele using the `-om / --output_mode` flag, which saves to the current directory:

```bash
hladl seq -a B*07:02 -om fasta
```


The location of the data directory can be determined using the `dd` command:
```bash
hladl dd

# Will produce something like
/path/to/where/its/saving/stuff
```

#### Notes

* If you run the `hladl seq` script without running the appropriate `hladl init`, it will try to download the appropriate sequences on the fly. 

* While the IMGTHLA repo does also store unspliced genomic DNA files, these are handled slightly different, are much larger files, and frankly I don't need them in my pipelines right now, so they're not yet catered to.

* Pseudogenes and other aberrent length entries in the dataset cannot be used for `ecd` mode.

### Importing `hladl` for use inside other scripts

The major case use I wanted `hladl` for is to import in other scripts, to allow for easy in-line grabbing of HLA sequences. It can be done by simple importing the relevant components and calling the `seq` function:

```bash
from hladl.hladl import seq
from hladl.main import data_dir

seq1 = seq('A*02:01', 4, 'prot', 'ecd', 'stdout', data_dir)
print(seq1)
