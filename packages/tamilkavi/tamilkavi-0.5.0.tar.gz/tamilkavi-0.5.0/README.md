## About Project

Tamil Kavi is a simple and intuitive command-line tool designed to provide easy access to a curated collection of Tamil poetry. It empowers users to navigate through poems by listing authors, books, and titles, and by applying filters to find specific content. The poetry data is included as JSON files within the package, making the tool self-contained after installation.

This project serves as a command-line companion and is proudly associated with the website [tamilkavi.com](https://tamilkavi.com), which offers additional details about it.

## Installation & Run the Project

You can install `tamilkavi` directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using pip, the standard Python package installer:

```bash
pip install tamilkavi
````

This command will download and install the `tamilkavi` package and its dependencies (like `prettytable`) automatically.

Once the installation is complete, you can run the `tamilkavi` command from any terminal window.

Here is the usage information and examples:

### Contributing via GitHub

If you're familiar with GitHub, this is our preferred method as it maintains proper versioning and attribution of contributions. You will be directly adding data to the project's source files.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1.  **Fork the repository:** Start by forking our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/tamilkavi) to your own account.
2.  **Navigate to the data directory:** In your forked repository, navigate to the `tamilkavi/kavisrc/` directory.
3.  **Find or create the author's file:** Look for a JSON file named after the author (e.g., `jothi.json`). If the author doesn't exist, create a new JSON file using their name in lowercase.
4.  **Add/Update the JSON data:** Add or update the poem data within the author's JSON file, following the specified structure for `author`, `contact`, and the `books` array. Ensure the structure for each `book` and `context` entry is correct.
5.  **Commit your changes:** Commit the changes to your forked repository with a clear and concise commit message.
6.  **Submit a pull request (PR):** Create a pull request from your forked repository's branch to the main `TamilKavi` repository's `main` branch. Provide a clear title and description of the poems you've added or updated.
