# Initialize the CocoIndex Library

Before everything starts, the `cocoindex` library needs to be initialized with settings.
There're two options to do this:

*   Using packaged main function. It's easier to start with.
*   Explicit initialization. It's more flexible.

## Using Packaged Main

The easiest way is to use a packaged main function:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

The `@cocoindex.main_fn` decorator wraps your main function for CocoIndex:

```python
import cocoindex

@cocoindex.main_fn()
def main():
  ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This takes care of the following effects:

1.  Initialize the library with settings loaded from environment variables, if not explicitly provided.
2.  If the program is executed with the `cocoindex` command, CocoIndex CLI will take over the control.
    It provides a bunch of commands for easily managing and inspecting indexes.
    See [CocoIndex CLI](/docs/core/cli) for more details.
3.  Otherwise, it will run the main function.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are supported:

*   `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the Postgres database to use as the internal storage, e.g. `postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex`

## Explicit Initialization

Alternatively, for flexibility, you can also explicitly initialize the library by the `init()` function:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
import cocoindex

def main():
  ...
  cocoindex.init(cocoindex.Settings(database_url="postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex"))
  ...

...
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
