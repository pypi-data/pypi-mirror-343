# Dax - The Password Module

Dax is a simple way to _**create passwords and use then however you want!**_ If it's from cloud account protection, or to make a buddy that can auto-generate passwords for you!

**!!DISCLAIMER!!**

_**Dax does not come with any intellegent password creation,**_ it only comprises of a custom list that generates a random string of items with a certain length, so _**it should not be trusted with anything that contains any personal information, or data you wish not to share.**_

Example:
```python
import daxpass

print(daxpass.createpass(['a', 'b'], 5))
```
Output:
baaba
