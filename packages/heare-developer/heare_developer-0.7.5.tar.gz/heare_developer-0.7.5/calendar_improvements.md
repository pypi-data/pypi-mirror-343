# Calendar Tool Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed the datetime format for API calls**
   - Problem: The calendar API was receiving malformed timeMin and timeMax parameters
   - The code was incorrectly appending 'Z' to the ISO format strings that already contained timezone information (e.g., `+00:00Z`)
   - Solution: Use `strftime` to format the datetime in RFC 3339 format (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) instead of using `isoformat() + "Z"`

2. **Fixed missing variable in calendar_search**
   - Added the `date_range_description` variable that was missing in the `calendar_search` function

## Testing

The fixes were verified by creating a test script (`test_calendar_fixed.py`) that tests both direct API calls and the tool function. Both approaches now work correctly.

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:
1. Calendar events can be listed correctly
2. Date parameters are properly formatted when making API requests
3. Both specific date queries and relative time-frame queries function properly

## Future Improvement Suggestions

1. Consider adding consistent error handling for timezone issues
2. Add more comprehensive validation of date inputs
3. Consider caching timezone information to reduce API calls
4. Add option to filter events by type (all-day vs. timed events)
