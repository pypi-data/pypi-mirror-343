        "Title": "Adaptive Multimodal Instruction and Co-Training for Edge-Efficient On-Device AI",
        "Abstract": "We present Adaptive Multimodal Instruction and Co-Training (AMICT), a novel lightweight transformer-based language model that builds upon the efficient design of BTLM-3B-8K while addressing its limitations. AMICT incorporates a dual-stage multimodal pretraining scheme that integrates high-quality text with aligned image and audio cues, advanced instruction-tuning with reinforcement learning and web-aided feedback, and a dynamic context modulation mechanism that adapts attention based on input semantic density. In addition, our hardware–software co-design ensures that the model remains quantization-friendly and optimized for on-device inference, substantially reducing memory and computational requirements to a level comparable with 7B parameter models. We validate AMICT through three reproducible experiments: a multimodal instruction-following evaluation using benchmark image-text pairs, a long-context handling test that examines performance on tasks with approximately 2K, 8K, and 10K tokens, and an on-device inference benchmark that demonstrates improved latency and reduced memory consumption. Our results reveal significant gains in response quality, robust long-context performance, and overall efficiency compared to the Base Method. This framework opens new avenues for interactive applications on mobile and edge devices.",
        "Introduction": "Recent advances in autoregressive transformer models have focused on scaling performance while reducing resource demands. The BTLM-3B-8K model epitomizes this trend by achieving performance competitive with larger 7B models through aggressive training on high-quality, deduplicated datasets and the use of innovations such as the SwiGLU activation function and ALiBi positional embeddings. However, BTLM-3B-8K exhibits limitations including restricted instruction-following capabilities, an exclusive reliance on textual data, and challenges in processing extended contexts. To address these drawbacks, we propose Adaptive Multimodal Instruction and Co-Training (AMICT), which retains the compact efficiency of BTLM-3B-8K while enhancing its adaptability and contextual grounding. Our contributions include: 1) a dual-stage multimodal pretraining regime that augments text with aligned image and audio data; 2) an enhanced instruction-tuning phase incorporating reinforcement learning and real-world interactive feedback; 3) a dynamic context modulation mechanism that adjusts attention distributions according to semantic density, thereby supporting inputs longer than standard limits; and 4) a hardware–software co-design that optimizes the model for on-device inference. The remainder of this paper details our methodology, experimental setups, and results, demonstrating that AMICT elevates performance across a range of tasks while maintaining a low computational footprint.",
        "Related Work": "Prior research in efficient language modeling has pursued the quality–size trade-off as exemplified by BTLM-3B-8K, which employs techniques such as maximal update parameterization (µP), SwiGLU activations, and ALiBi positional embeddings to deliver 7B-class performance with only 3B parameters. Other approaches, including those inspired by Megrez-Omni, have explored multimodal and multi-stage training methods to improve edge efficiency. However, these models typically remain constrained to text-only inputs or rely on large parameter counts, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, AMICT synthesizes insights from both BTLM-3B-8K and recent multimodal strategies by integrating non-textual data and dynamic attention mechanisms into a unified framework. Our approach is compared with these related methods, and we demonstrate that the integration of multimodal pretraining and dynamic context handling substantially enhances both adaptability and resource efficiency.",
        "Background": "The BTLM-3B-8K model is based on a GPT-3–style architecture and incorporates several modifications to improve long-context extrapolation. Key innovations include the adoption of the SwiGLU nonlinearity, ALiBi positional embeddings for better handling of extended sequences, and maximal update parameterization (µP) which transfers optimal hyperparameters from a smaller proxy model. Trained on a deduplicated and cleaned version of the SlimPajama dataset comprising 627 billion tokens, BTLM-3B-8K achieves competitive performance using only 3GB of memory at 4-bit precision. Despite these advances, its focus on textual tasks hampers its ability to handle instruction-following problems and multimodal inputs. Recent developments in multimodal learning have shown that integrating images and audio can enrich contextual representations, while dynamic context modulation techniques help alleviate performance degradation in very long sequences. Furthermore, hardware–software co-design practices, such as quantization-friendly architectures and distributed resource scheduling, enable the deployment of large models on mobile and edge devices. These foundational advances motivate the design choices behind AMICT.",
        "Method": "AMICT extends the efficient architecture of BTLM-3B-8K through four key innovations. First, the model is pretrained using a dual-stage multimodal approach, wherein a blended corpus of high-quality text, captioned images, and short audio segments is used to enhance contextual grounding. Modular encoders process the non-textual inputs in parallel with the primary text module, while cross-modal attention blocks integrate these diverse representations. Second, a multi-stage instruction-tuning phase is applied, incorporating reinforcement learning and web-aided feedback to improve factual accuracy and reduce biases, thereby enabling the model to generate context-aware and reliable outputs even when processing mixed-modal cues. Third, AMICT introduces dynamic context modulation modules that adjust the attention distribution based on the semantic density of the input, ensuring robust performance as the input length exceeds typical token limits. Finally, the overall design follows hardware–software co-design principles; the architecture is quantization-friendly and optimized using tools like TorchScript, making it suitable for on-device inference with significantly reduced latency and memory consumption. Together, these components yield a versatile model capable of delivering enhanced performance across multimodal and long-context tasks while remaining computationally efficient.",
        "Experimental Setup": "We designed three experiments to demonstrate AMICT’s advantages over the Base Method derived from BTLM-3B-8K. The first experiment evaluates multimodal instruction-following performance using a benchmark dataset of aligned text and image pairs. A PyTorch-based pipeline leverages PIL for image preprocessing and Hugging Face transformers for text tokenization, and task accuracy is measured using BLEU scores alongside qualitative assessments of how well the model integrates visual cues into its responses. In the second experiment, we assess long-context handling by feeding text tasks of varying lengths (approximately 2K, 8K, and 10K tokens) into both models. We record metrics such as response coherence, latency, and inspect internal attention patterns to evaluate the effect of dynamic context modulation. The third experiment benchmarks on-device inference by deploying both AMICT and the Base Method in a simulated edge environment. Using techniques such as dynamic quantization and TorchScript, we measure inference latency, memory consumption, and throughput with Python profiling tools. All experiments were conducted on standard hardware configurations with reproducible code, and the results are visualized using PDF plots generated by matplotlib.",
        "Results": "The experimental results confirm that AMICT effectively overcomes the limitations of the Base Method. In the multimodal instruction-following evaluation, AMICT demonstrated improved performance through its effective integration of visual cues, yielding higher task accuracy and better alignment between image content and generated text responses. In the long-context experiment, dynamic context modulation allowed AMICT to maintain stable response coherence and minimal latency even as input lengths extended beyond 8K tokens. The on-device inference benchmark revealed that AMICT’s hardware–software co-design significantly reduced both memory consumption and inference latency, thereby making it well-suited for edge deployments. Quantitative measurements, including average latency figures and memory usage changes, consistently favored AMICT, and supporting figures—such as bar charts comparing resource usage and plots of latency versus token length—highlight these improvements.",
        "Conclusions": "We introduced Adaptive Multimodal Instruction and Co-Training (AMICT), a method that enhances the compact BTLM-3B-8K architecture by integrating multimodal pretraining, advanced instruction tuning, dynamic context modulation, and a hardware–software co-design for efficient on-device inference. Our experiments demonstrate that AMICT significantly improves adaptability and contextual grounding in multimodal instruction-following tasks, robustly handles long-context inputs, and reduces resource consumption compared to the Base Method. Although challenges such as performance degradation with extremely long contexts and biases inherent in training data remain, future work will focus on optimizing training schedules, exploring multilingual extensions, and incorporating fine-tuning for interactive, chat-based applications. Overall, AMICT represents a significant step toward deploying high-quality, adaptive AI models on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices.",
