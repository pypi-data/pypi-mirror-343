A Python package for calculating RTAC, the rank-transform area coverage coefficient of correlation. This is the official repository of the paper (link TBD):

"A coefficient of correlation for continuous random variables based on area coverage"

## Installation

Install this library using `pip`:
```bash
pip install rtacpy
```
## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from rtacpy import calc_rtac, create_null_dist, area_coverage_independence_test
n = 100
x = np.random.rand(n)
y = np.random.rand(n)
null_dist = create_null_dist(n)
rtac, p_value = area_coverage_independence_test(x, y, null_dist=null_dist)
print(f'x and y are independent, rtac = {rtac}, p_value = {p_value}')
y = np.square(x)
rtac, p_value = area_coverage_independence_test(x, y, null_dist=null_dist)
print(f'x and y are dependent, rtac = {rtac}, p_value = {p_value}')

# If p_value is not needed, you can calculate just rtac
rtac_2 = calc_rtac(x,y)
assert rtac == rtac_2
```

## Development

To contribute to this library, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
cd rtacpy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
```
To run the tests:
```bash
python -m pytest
```
