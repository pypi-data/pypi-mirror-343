# wkt

wkt makes it easy to grab Well-Known Text strings for countries, states, and cities around the world.

Here's how you can grab the polygon for New York State for example:

```python
import wkt

wkt.us.states.new_york()
```

`wkt` is interoperable with many Pythonic geospatial tools like Shapely, GeoPandas, Sedona, and Dask!

## Installation

Just run `pip install wkt`.

This library doesn't have any dependencies, so it's easy to install anywhere.
