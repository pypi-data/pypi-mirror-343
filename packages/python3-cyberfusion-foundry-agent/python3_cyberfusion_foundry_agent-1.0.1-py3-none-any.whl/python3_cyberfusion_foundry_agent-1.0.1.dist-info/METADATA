# python3-cyberfusion-foundry-agent

VM/device agent for Foundry.

The agent provides the following modules, passing information to Foundry:

* Heartbeat
    * Sends a heartbeat to Foundry on boot

# Install

## PyPI

Run the following command to install the package from PyPI:

    pip3 install python3-cyberfusion-foundry-agent

## Debian

# Configure

Find an example configuration in `etc/foundry-agent.yml`.

To use the agent, the UUID must be configured.
It is used to uniquely identify VMs/devices in Foundry, and therefore must be retrieved from Foundry.
