# RSIPI: Robot Sensor Interface - Python Integration

RSIPI is a high-performance, Python-based communication and control system designed for real-time interfacing with KUKA robots using the Robot Sensor Interface (RSI) protocol. It provides both a robust **API** for developers and a powerful **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for researchers and engineers who need to monitor, control, and analyse robotic movements in real time.

üõ°Ô∏è Safety Notice
RSIPI is a powerful tool that directly interfaces with industrial robotic systems. Improper use can lead to dangerous movements, property damage, or personal injury.

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines
Test in Simulation First
Always verify your RSI communication and trajectories using simulation tools before deploying to a live robot.

Enable Emergency Stops
Ensure all safety hardware (E-Stop, fencing, light curtains) is active and functioning correctly.

Supervised Operation Only
Run RSIPI only in supervised environments with trained personnel present.

Limit Movement Ranges
Use KUKA Workspaces or software limits to constrain movement, especially when testing new code.

Use Logging for Debugging
Avoid debugging while RSI is active; instead, enable CSV logging and review logs post-run.

Secure Network Configuration
Ensure your RSI network is on a closed, isolated interface to avoid external interference or spoofing.

Never Rely on RSIPI for Safety
RSIPI is not a safety-rated system. Do not use it in applications where failure could result in harm.

## üìÑ Description

RSIPI allows users to:
- Communicate with KUKA robots using the RSI XML-based protocol.
- Dynamically update control variables (TCP position, joint angles, I/O, external axes, etc.).
- Log and visualise robot movements.
- Analyse motion data and compare planned vs actual trajectories.

### Target Audience
- **Researchers** working on advanced robotic applications, control algorithms, and feedback systems.
- **Engineers** developing robotic workflows or automated processes.
- **Educators** using real robots in coursework or lab environments.
- **Students** learning about robot control systems and data-driven motion planning.

## üìä API Overview (`rsi_api.py`)

### Initialization

```python
from src.RSIPI import rsi_api

api = rsi_api.RSIAPI(config_path='examples/RSI_EthernetConfig.xml')
```

### Methods
| Method | CLI | API | Description |
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|
| `start_rsi()` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Starts RSI communication (non-blocking). |
| `stop_rsi()` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Stops RSI communication. |
| `update_variable(path, value)` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Dynamically updates a send variable (e.g. `RKorr.X`). |

| `enable_graphing(mode='tcp')` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Enables real-time graphing (TCP or joint). |
| `disable_graphing()` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Disables graphing. |
| `plan_linear_cartesian(start, end, steps)` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Creates a Cartesian path. |
| `plan_linear_joint(start, end, steps)` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Creates a joint-space path. |

Start the CLI:
```bash
python main.py --cli
```

### Available Commands:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `start` | Starts the RSI client. |
| `stop` | Stops RSI communication. |
| `set <variable> <value>` | Updates a send variable. |
| `get <variable>` | Displays the current value of a variable. |

## üìÉ Examples

### Start RSI and update Cartesian coordinates
```python
api.start_rsi()
api.update_variable('RKorr.X', 100.0)
api.update_variable('RKorr.Y', 200.0)
api.update_variable('RKorr.Z', 300.0)
```

### Retrieve joint positions
```python
a1 = api.get_variable('AIPos.A1')
```

### Plan and execute Cartesian trajectory
```python
start = {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'Z': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0}
end   = {'X': 100, 'Y': 100, 'Z': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0}
traj = api.plan_linear_cartesian(start, end, steps=50)
api.execute_trajectory(traj)
```

### CLI Sample
```bash
> start
> set RKorr.X 150
> set DiO 255
> get AIPos.A1
> log on
> graph on
> stop
```
