# RSIPI: Robot Sensor Interface - Python Integration

RSIPI is a high-performance, Python-based communication and control system designed for real-time interfacing with KUKA robots using the Robot Sensor Interface (RSI) protocol. It provides both a robust **API** for developers and a powerful **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for researchers and engineers who need to monitor, control, and analyse robotic movements in real time.

üõ°Ô∏è Safety Notice
RSIPI is a powerful tool that directly interfaces with industrial robotic systems. Improper use can lead to dangerous movements, property damage, or personal injury.

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines
- **Test in Simulation First:** Always verify your RSI communication and trajectories using simulation tools before deploying to a live robot.
- **Enable Emergency Stops:** Ensure all safety hardware (E-Stop, fencing, light curtains) is active and functioning correctly.
- **Supervised Operation Only:** Run RSIPI only in supervised environments with trained personnel present.
- **Limit Movement Ranges:** Use KUKA Workspaces or software limits to constrain movement, especially when testing new code.
- **Use Logging for Debugging:** Avoid debugging while RSI is active; instead, enable CSV logging and review logs post-run.
- **Secure Network Configuration:** Ensure your RSI network is on a closed, isolated interface to avoid external interference or spoofing.
- **Never Rely on RSIPI for Safety:** RSIPI is not a safety-rated system. Do not use it in applications where failure could result in harm.

## üìÑ Description

RSIPI allows users to:
- Communicate with KUKA robots using the RSI XML-based protocol.
- Dynamically update control variables (TCP position, joint angles, I/O, external axes, etc.).
- Log and visualise robot movements with live graphs and static plots.
- Analyse motion data and compare planned vs actual trajectories.
- Parse and inject RSI into KRL programs.
- Simulate robot behaviour using a realistic Echo Server.
- Enforce safety limits and manage emergency stops.

### Target Audience
- **Researchers** working on advanced robotic applications, control algorithms, and feedback systems.
- **Engineers** developing robotic workflows or automated processes.
- **Educators** using real robots in coursework or lab environments.
- **Students** learning about robot control systems and data-driven motion planning.

## üìÉ Example Usage

### Update TCP position live
```python
api.start_rsi()
api.update_variable('RKorr.X', 100.0)
api.update_variable('RKorr.Y', 50.0)
```

### Plan and execute a Cartesian move
```python
start_pose = {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'Z': 500}
end_pose = {'X': 200, 'Y': 0, 'Z': 500}
traj = api.plan_linear_cartesian(start_pose, end_pose, steps=100)
api.execute_trajectory(traj, rate=0.012)
