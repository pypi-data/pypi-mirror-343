The goal is to structure the evidence in a way that allows for a thorough and interpretable comparison, enabling an LLM to estimate the likelihood under both h1 and h0.

The code should:
- The output should be data/evidence, instead of test statistics. 
- Organize the evidence for h1 and h0 in a structured format, including metrics and qualitative descriptors.
- Provide outputs that are interpretable, enabling easy comparison between the likelihoods of h1 and h0.

You have access to the following pandas dataframe tables, where each table shows precise column names and an example row:

Write code based on the user’s request. Ensure any code provided is self-contained, executable, and includes all necessary imports and variable definitions.

Structure your output as follows:
1) A brief summary of the approach, 
2) The required imports, 
3) The complete code.

Include progress bars for lengthy processes where appropriate and optimize for time efficiency by using a small number of permutations (e.g., <1000) where relevant. 
Do not use placeholders. Each output should directly relate to the evidence under h1 and h0.

The output should provide a comparison-ready format for h1 and h0. You should print the output in the code.

2. Estimate the probability of this evidence under the null hypothesis, P(data|h0).

Follow this rigorous rubric to evaluate estimation precision, focusing on both theoretical grounding and accuracy in likelihood estimation:

- **0.1**: Extremely poor estimate, lacks theoretical grounding; estimation is inconsistent with evidence and does not consider hypothesis structure.
- **0.2**: Poor estimate; limited theoretical basis, fails to account for evidence specifics, and overlooks key elements of hypothesis testing.
- **0.3**: Weak estimate, marginally considers evidence but lacks appropriate statistical measures or fails to apply probability theory accurately.
- **0.4**: Below average; applies some basic probability theory but lacks rigor, poorly models the relationship between evidence and hypothesis.
- **0.5**: Average estimate; applies probability theory minimally, captures some evidence but with limited specificity to the hypothesis context.
- **0.6**: Above average; uses sound statistical principles, somewhat models the evidence-hypothesis relationship, but with notable gaps or simplifications.
- **0.7**: Good estimate; well-grounded in theory, evidence is modeled with reasonable accuracy but lacks precision or depth in interpretation.
- **0.8**: Very good estimate; rigorous application of probability theory, models evidence in the context of hypothesis well, with minor limitations in capturing uncertainty or alternative explanations.
- **0.9**: Excellent estimate; highly accurate, theoretically sound, robustly interprets evidence under hypothesis, addressing key uncertainties and incorporating evidence nuances.
- **1.0**: Perfect estimate; fully grounded in advanced probability theory, comprehensive and precise, accurately modeling all aspects of evidence given the hypothesis, leaving no uncertainties unaddressed.

---
**Process**:
- First, produce an initial estimate proposal.
- In each round i, perform the following steps:
    1. **Critique**: Evaluate the estimation’s reasonableness, theoretical rigor, and alignment with this rubric.
    2. **Reflect**: Identify specific improvements to enhance accuracy and theoretical grounding based on critique.
- If the estimation achieves a rigorous standard (e.g., reaching 0.9 or 1.0), return the final estimates:
    - P(data|h1) = [final value]
    - P(data|h0) = [final value]
- If refinement is needed, improve or propose a new estimation, then proceed to the next round.

Given a {domain} hypothesis "{main_hypothesis}", your goal is to propose a novel falsification test given the available {domain} data sources. 
A falsification test is a test that can potentially falsify the main hypothesis. 
The outcome of the falsification test is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.

Notably, the falsification test should satisfy the following property: if the main hypotheiss is null, then the falsification sub-hypothesis should also be null. 

Here are the list of available data sources, and you can directly call the dataframe as it has already been loaded; no need to load from file path. Each is a pandas dataframe with columns and example rows:

{data}

For the final test, return
(1) Name: name of the test
(2) Test description: be clear and concise. Describe the falsification outcomes.
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: what is the statistical null sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: what is the statistical alternative sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?

Here are the falsification tests that you've created in the previous rounds and their corresponding test results:

"""
{existing_falsification_test}
"""

You may use these information to formulate your next subhypothesis and falsification test, but make sure the proposed falsification test is non-redundant with any of the existing tests.

The proposed test should also avoid these failed falsification tests in the previous rounds:

"""
{failed_falsification_test}
"""

A good falsification test should serve as a strong evidence for the main hypothesis. However, make sure it is answerable with the given available data sources.
You should aim to maximize the implication strength of the proposed falsification test using the relevant parts of the provided data.

---- 
First produce an initial falsification test proposal.

Then, in each round i, you will do the following:
(1) critic: ask if the main hypothesis is null, is this test also null? be rigorous. this is super important, otherwise, the test is invalid. Is it redundant on capabilities with existing tests? Is it overlapping with failed tests? Can this be answered and implemented based on the given data? 
(2) reflect: how to improve this test definition. 

If you think the test definition is good enough, return the final test definition to the user. 
If not, either refine the test definition that is better than the previous one or propose a new test definition, then go to the next round.

Each score level represents a different degree of relevance based on evidence strength, mechanistic connection, and predictive value of the test results.

Rubric:

1.0 - Highly Relevant: The sub-hypothesis provides direct evidence or a clear mechanistic insight that strongly supports or refutes the main hypothesis. The test is specific to variables or mechanisms involved in the main hypothesis, with significant predictive value.
0.8 - Strongly Relevant: The test addresses a major component of the main hypothesis, providing substantial supporting or refuting evidence, and shows strong mechanistic alignment. The results would significantly impact the confidence in the main hypothesis.
0.6 - Moderately Relevant: The test examines elements supporting the main hypothesis without direct mechanistic insight. Some aspects align with the main hypothesis, offering moderate predictive value.
0.4 - Slightly Relevant: The test is related to the main hypothesis but provides limited direct evidence. It explores loosely associated variables and has minimal predictive value.
0.2 - Barely Relevant: The test is tangentially related, providing minimal information that could impact the main hypothesis, with no clear mechanistic link and negligible predictive value.
0.1 - Irrelevant: The sub-hypothesis does not provide relevant evidence or mechanistic connection to the main hypothesis, with no predictive value.

Instructions:
