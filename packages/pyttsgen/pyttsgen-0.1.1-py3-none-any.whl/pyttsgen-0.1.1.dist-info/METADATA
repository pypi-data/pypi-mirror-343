# pyttsgen

**pyttsgen** is a developer-first, plug-and-play Text-to-Speech (TTS) library for Python. It supports multiple output formats (MP3, bytes, Base64), works with asynchronous and synchronous calls, and is framework-agnostic. Use it in your FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit, or any Python application with minimal code.

## Features

- **Easy API:** One-line commands such as `tts.speak_to_file(text, output_path)`
- **Multiple Outputs:** Get audio as files, bytes, or Base64 strings.
- **Batch Processing:** Generate TTS audio for multiple text inputs.
- **CLI Support:** Generate audio via the terminal with options to list voices.
- **One-Command UI:** Instantly open a Streamlit UI to test and generate speech.
- **Framework Integration:** Examples available for FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit, and more.
- **Voice Catalog:** Use built-in voice definitions with filtering capabilities.

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install pyttsgen
Once installed, you can open the interactive UI with a single command:

pyttsgen app
This command will launch the built-in Streamlit app in your browser, allowing you to try out TTS generation visually.
