## Motivation

**SAWTY**: Privacy, security, authenticity.

"My Vote, My Voice" is building a fully quantum-secure electronic voting system that redefines trust in decision-making.  
We ensure end-to-end ballot security, anonymity, consensus, and voter authentication, setting a new global standard for trustworthy elections.

---

## Features

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: secure keys for ballot encryption.
- **Quantum-Safe Digital Signatures**: voter authentication without compromising anonymity.
- **Encrypted, Anonymized Ballots**: votes are end-to-end encrypted with zero leakage.
- **Blockchain Consensus**: votes are recorded only after a Byzantine agreement between tallying nodes.
- **Built-in Simulation Tools**: easily test small- to medium-scale elections with quantum-secure infrastructure.

## Usage Example

You can quickly simulate a quantum-secure election by running:

```python
import sawty
import time

# Define choices and voters
CHOICES = ["YES", "NO", "ABSTAIN"]
VOTER_CHOICES = {
    "Aya": "YES",
    "Bassem": "NO",
    "Charlie": "ABSTAIN",
    "Dana": "NO",
    "Ella": "NO",
}

QKD_KEY_LENGTH = 32

# Initialize nodes
voters = [Voter(name, qkd_key_length=QKD_KEY_LENGTH) for name in VOTER_CHOICES.keys()]
voter_dict = {voter.id: voter.public_key for voter in voters}
auth = Authenticator("AuthNode", voter_dict, qkd_key_length=QKD_KEY_LENGTH)
talliers = [Tallier(f"TallyNode{i+1}", qkd_key_length=QKD_KEY_LENGTH) for i in range(3)]
blockchain = Blockchain(talliers)

# Quantum key distribution
for voter in voters:
    voter.establish_qkd_channel(auth)
    for tally in talliers:
        voter.establish_qkd_channel(tally)
for tally in talliers:
    auth.establish_qkd_channel(tally)

# Voting process
for voter in voters:
    voter.sign_identity()
    choice = CHOICES.index(VOTER_CHOICES[voter.name])
    vote_payload = voter.send_vote(choice, auth, talliers[0])
    signature_hex, forwarded_vote = auth.forward_vote(vote_payload, talliers[0], voter)
    for tally in talliers:
        vote = tally.receive_vote(forwarded_vote, auth)
        tally.add_vote(signature_hex, vote)

# Blockchain and consensus
snapshot = talliers[0].received_votes.copy()
timestamp = time.time()
blocks = [blockchain.propose_block(snapshot, t, fixed_creator="TallyConsensus", fixed_timestamp=timestamp) for t in talliers]

if blockchain.byzantine_agreement(blocks):
    blockchain.display_chain()
    blockchain.save_json("blockchain.json")
    blockchain.simple_majority()
```
