# ETLX Python Wrapper

**ETLX** is a modern and highly configurable ETL and reporting tool powered by DuckDB.  
This Python package provides a simple interface to run ETLX workflows directly from Python.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install the wrapper from PyPI:

```bash
pip install etlx-wrapper
```

### ðŸ§© Requirements

You also need the ETLX binary:

1. Download the latest binary for your platform from  
   [ETLX Releases](https://github.com/realdatadriven/etlx/releases)
2. Place it in your system `PATH`, or provide the binary path manually when using the wrapper.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```python
from etlx_wrapper import ETLX
import datetime

etxl = ETLX()\
    .config = "/path/to/config.md"\
    .only = "keyX"\
    .date = datetime.date.today()\
    .file = "data.csv"\
    .execute()
```

You can also pass the path to the ETLX binary if it's not in `PATH`:

```python
runner = ETLX(config="config.md", bin="/path/to/etlx-linux-amd64")
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Runs full ETLX workflows from Python  
- Supports `.env` configuration  
- Automatically formats Python `date` objects  
- Compatible with advanced CLI options: `--only`, `--skip`, `--steps`, `--clean`, `--drop`, etc.
