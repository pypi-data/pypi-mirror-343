**Dispy** is a Python library for making Discord bots that abstracts all the asynchronous programming and API interaction away. Dispy is different from discord.py and discord.js as it allows the user to write normal Python code and does not need intents, event loops, or async functions. Dispy does everything asynchronously in the background, meaning high performance without the developer having to deal with any of it.

Dispy enables bot creators to focus on their idea and their bots' structure instead of getting bogged down with learning an API. It makes development easier so that innovative concepts can be actualized without the frustration that normally comes with it.
