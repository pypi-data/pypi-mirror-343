The purpose of this Python module is to simplify common Dataverse Project (https://dataverse.org/) API requests for data curation (designed for the Dataverse v5.13 and greater).

## Why use this module

The Dataverse Project API has more than one API, which can be confusing to understand and put to use, especially for those new to using an API. This module provides simple to use functions for most commonly used data curation processes.

## Using the package

The easiest way to test and work with this module is via a Jupyter Notebook designed specifically for use with this module. The Notebook can be found under the [Getted Started section](https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test/edit/main/README.md#get-started) at https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test. An online virtual environment is provided to test this module without the need to build your own Python environment from scratch.
