fix: missing uv run in release pipeline (#1542)

# Description

I was missing a `uv run` from the `release.yaml` pipeline. Repeating the
changelog and bump from #1538 as that was not released as a result of
that bug.


Found another issue, `uv build` excludes the file `build.py` inside the
`commands` modules, this is the result of installing the wheel in a
fresh environment.

Renaming it to `build_cmd.py` resolved the issue.

### Changed

- Currently the `--host=` option value is ignored if it does not
case-sensitively match a value in the `REPOSITORY_HOSTING` array. This
change makes the matching case-insensitive and falls back to the "Other"
repository hosting option if no match is found.

## templates

No changes.
