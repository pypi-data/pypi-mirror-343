# Hello World with Dapr Agents

This quickstart provides a hands-on introduction to Dapr Agents through simple examples. You'll learn the fundamentals of working with LLMs, creating basic agents, implementing the ReAct pattern, and setting up simple workflows - all in less than 20 lines of code per example.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 (recommended)
- pip package manager
- OpenAI API key

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment 
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Examples

### 1. Basic LLM Usage

Run the basic LLM example to see how to interact with OpenAI's language models:

<!-- STEP
name: Run basic LLM example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "Got response:"
timeout_seconds: 30
output_match_mode: substring
-->
```bash
python 01_ask_llm.py
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

This example demonstrates the simplest way to use Dapr Agents' OpenAIChatClient:

```python
from dapr_agents import OpenAIChatClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
llm = OpenAIChatClient()
response = llm.generate("Tell me a joke")
print("Got response:", response.get_content())
```

**Expected output:** The LLM will respond with a joke.

### 2. Simple Agent with Tools

Run the agent example to see how to create an agent with custom tools:

<!-- STEP
name: Run simple agent with tools example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "user:"
  - "What's the weather?"
  - "assistant:"
  - "Function name: MyWeatherFunc"
  - "MyWeatherFunc(tool)"
  - "It's 72°F and sunny"
  - "assistant:"
  - "The current weather is 72°F and sunny."
timeout_seconds: 30
output_match_mode: substring
-->
```bash
python 02_build_agent.py
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

This example shows how to create a basic agent with a custom tool:

```python
import asyncio
from dapr_agents import tool, Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

@tool
def my_weather_func() -> str:
    """Get current weather."""
    return "It's 72°F and sunny"

async def main():
    weather_agent = Agent(
        name="WeatherAgent",
        role="Weather Assistant",
        instructions=["Help users with weather information"],
        tools=[my_weather_func]
    )

    response = await weather_agent.run("What's the weather?")
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Expected output:** The agent will use the weather tool to provide the current weather.

### 3. ReAct Pattern Implementation

Run the ReAct pattern example to see how to create an agent that can reason and act:

<!-- STEP
name: Run simple agent with tools example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "user:"
  - "What should I do in London today?"
  - "Thought:"
  - 'Action: {"name": "SearchWeather", "arguments": {"city": "London"}}'
  - "Observation: rainy"
  - "Thought:"
  - 'Action: {"name": "GetActivities", "arguments": {"weather": "rainy"}}'
  - "Observation: Visit museums"
  - "Thought:"
  - "assistant:"
  - "Result:"
timeout_seconds: 30
output_match_mode: substring
-->
```bash
python 03_reason_act.py
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

```python
import asyncio
from dapr_agents import tool, ReActAgent
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

@tool
def search_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather information for a city."""
    weather_data = {"london": "rainy", "paris": "sunny"}
    return weather_data.get(city.lower(), "Unknown")

@tool
def get_activities(weather: str) -> str:
    """Get activity recommendations."""
    activities = {"rainy": "Visit museums", "sunny": "Go hiking"}
    return activities.get(weather.lower(), "Stay comfortable")

async def main():
    react_agent = ReActAgent(
        name="TravelAgent",
        role="Travel Assistant",
        instructions=["Check weather, then suggest activities"],
        tools=[search_weather, get_activities]
    )

    result = await react_agent.run("What should I do in London today?")
    if result:
        print("Result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Expected output:** The agent will first check the weather in London, find it's rainy, and then recommend visiting museums.

### 4. Simple Workflow

Make sure Dapr is initialized on your system:

```bash
dapr init
```

Run the workflow example to see how to create a multi-step LLM process:

<!-- STEP
name: Run a simple workflow example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "Outline:"
  - "Blog post:"
  - "Result:"
output_match_mode: substring
-->
```bash
dapr run --app-id dapr-agent-wf -- python 04_chain_tasks.py
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

This example demonstrates how to create a workflow with multiple tasks:

```python
from dapr_agents.workflow import WorkflowApp, workflow, task
from dapr.ext.workflow import DaprWorkflowContext

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

@workflow(name='analyze_topic')
def analyze_topic(ctx: DaprWorkflowContext, topic: str):
    # Each step is durable and can be retried
    outline = yield ctx.call_activity(create_outline, input=topic)
    blog_post = yield ctx.call_activity(write_blog, input=outline)
    return blog_post

@task(description="Create a detailed outline about {topic}")
def create_outline(topic: str) -> str:
    pass

@task(description="Write a comprehensive blog post following this outline: {outline}")
def write_blog(outline: str) -> str:
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    wfapp = WorkflowApp()

    results = wfapp.run_and_monitor_workflow_sync(
        analyze_topic,
        input="AI Agents"
    )
    print(f"Result: {results}")
```

**Expected output:** The workflow will create an outline about AI Agents and then generate a blog post based on that outline.

## Key Concepts

- **OpenAIChatClient**: The interface for interacting with OpenAI's LLMs
- **Agent**: A class that combines an LLM with tools and instructions
- **@tool decorator**: A way to create tools that agents can use
- **ReActAgent**: An agent that follows the Reasoning + Action pattern
- **WorkflowApp**: A Dapr-powered way to create stateful, multi-step processes

## Dapr Integration

These examples don't directly expose Dapr building blocks, but they're built on Dapr Agents which behind the scenes leverages the full capabilities of the Dapr runtime:

- **Resilience**: Built-in retry policies, circuit breaking, and timeout handling external systems interactions
- **Orchestration**: Stateful, durable workflows that can survive process restarts and continue execution from where they left off
- **Interoperability**: Pluggable component architecture that works with various backends and cloud services without changing application code
- **Scalability**: Distribute agents across infrastructure, from local development to multi-node Kubernetes clusters
- **Event-Driven**: Pub/Sub messaging for event-driven agent collaboration and coordination
- **Observability**: Integrated distributed tracing, metrics collection, and logging for visibility into agent operations
- **Security**: Protection through scoping, encryption, secret management, and authentication/authorization controls

In the later quickstarts, you'll see explicit Dapr integration through state stores, pub/sub, and workflow services.

## Troubleshooting

1. **API Key Issues**: If you see an authentication error, verify your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file
2. **Python Version**: If you encounter compatibility issues, make sure you're using Python 3.10+
3. **Environment Activation**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running examples
4. **Import Errors**: If you see module not found errors, verify that `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed successfully

## Next Steps

After completing these examples, move on to the [LLM Call quickstart](../02_llm_call_open_ai/README.md) to learn more about structured outputs from LLMs.
