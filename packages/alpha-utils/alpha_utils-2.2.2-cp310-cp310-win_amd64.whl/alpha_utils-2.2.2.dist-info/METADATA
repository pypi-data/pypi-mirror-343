# Cross-section

| Function| Definition |
|:---|:---|
|rank(x) | Cross-sectional rank|
|scale(x, a) | Rescaled x such that sum(abs(x)) = a (the default is a = 1)|
|indneutralize(x, g) | x cross-sectionally demeaned within groups g (subindustries, industries, etc.)

# Operators

- abs(x), log(x), sign(x), power(x, a) = standard definitions
- same for the operators “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”, “>”, “<”, “==”, “||”, “x ? y : z”

# Time Series

| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ts_{O}(x, d)            | Operator O applied to the time-series for the past d days; non-integer number of days d is converted to floor(d) |
| ts_lag(x, d)            | Value of x d days ago                                        |
| ts_delta(x, d)          | Difference between the value of x today and d days ago       |
| ts_weighted_mean(x, d)  | Weighted moving average over the past d days with linearly decaying weights d, d – 1, …, 1 (rescaled to sum up to 1) |
| ts_sum(x, d)            | Rolling sum over the past d days                             |
| ts_product(x, d)        | Rolling product over the past d days                         |
| ts_stddev(x, d)         | Moving standard deviation over the past d days               |
| ts_rank(x, d)           | Rank over the past d days                                    |
| ts_min(x, d)            | Rolling min over the past d days \[alias: min(x, d)\]        |
| ts_max(x, d)            | Rolling max over the past d days \[alias: max(x, d)\]        |
| ts_argmax(x, d)         | Day of ts_max(x, d)                                          |
| ts_argmin(x, d)         | Day of ts_min(x, d)                                          |
| ts_correlation(x, y, d) | Correlation of x and y for the past d days                   |
| ts_covariance(x, y, d)  | Covariance of x and y for the past d days                    |
