Features
========

- **Weighted Levenshtein Distance**: An adaptation of the classic Levenshtein algorithm with custom substitution costs for character pairs that are commonly confused in OCR models, including efficient batch processing.
- **Unicode Support**: Arbitrary unicode strings can be compared.
- **Substitution of Multiple Characters**: Not just character pairs, but string pairs may be substituted, for example the Korean syllable "이" for the two letters "OI".
- **Pre-defined OCR Distance Map**: A built-in distance map for common OCR confusions (e.g., "0" vs "O", "1" vs "l", "5" vs "S").
- **Best Match Finder**: Utility function ``find_best_candidate`` to efficiently find the best matching string from a collection of candidates using any specified distance function (including the library's OCR-aware ones).
