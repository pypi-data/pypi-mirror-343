              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

A modern interactive command-line application building library based on `prompt_toolkit`

**Language: English/[中文](README_cn.md)**

## 1. Features

- 🚀 Built on prompt_toolkit for powerful interactive experiences
- 📝 Automatic parameter parsing and completion  
- 🌈 Rich text output support (using rich library)
- ⚡ Native async command support
- 🔍 Built-in command completion and shortcut keys

## 2. Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ptcmd
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Visecy/ptcmd.git
cd ptcmd
make install
```

## 3. Quick Start

Create a simple command-line application:

```python
import sys
from ptcmd import Cmd

class MyApp(Cmd):
    def do_hello(self, argv: list[str]) -> None:
        """Hello World!"""
        if argv:
            name = argv[0]
        else:
            name = "World"
        self.poutput(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(MyApp().cmdloop())
```

In this basic example:

1. We create a `MyApp` class inheriting from `Cmd`
2. Define a `do_hello` command method
3. The command accepts an optional name parameter
4. Uses "World" if no parameter is provided
5. Output greeting using `self.poutput()`
6. Start the CLI with `cmdloop()`

This example demonstrates:
- Command definition syntax
- Parameter handling
- Output display
- Application startup process

Run the program and try the `hello` command:

```
(Cmd) hello
Hello, World!
(Cmd) hello Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

## 4. Advanced Features

### 4.1 Auto Argument Parsing

For complex commands, use the `auto_argument` decorator with type hints for automatic argument parsing:

```python
from ptcmd import Cmd, Arg, auto_argument

class MathApp(Cmd):
    @auto_argument
    def do_add(
        self,
        x: float,
        y: float,
        *,
        verbose: Arg[bool, "-v", "--verbose"] = False
    ) -> None:
        """Add two numbers"""
        result = x + y
        if verbose:
            self.poutput(f"{x} + {y} = {result}")
        else:
            self.poutput(result)
```

This approach automatically generates equivalent argparse code:
- Converts positional parameters to required arguments
- Converts keyword parameters to optional flags
- Handles type conversion and validation

### 4.2 Rich Text Output

Leverage rich library for styled output:

```python
class RichApp(Cmd):
    def do_hello(self, argv: list[str]) -> None:
        self.poutput(f"[bold blue]Hello, World![/bold blue]")
```

For advanced formatting, access the console directly:

```python
class RichApp(Cmd):
    def do_hello(self, argv: list[str]) -> None:
        with self.console.pager(styles=True):
            self.console.print("Hello, World!", style="bold blue")
```

### 4.3 Subcommand Support

For command functions that use the automatic parameter parsing feature, `ptcmd` allows you to add any number of sub-commands to them in a simple way. The execution order of command functions is starting from the root command and then executing them one by one.

1. Single-level subcommand example:

```python
from ptcmd import Cmd, auto_argument

class App(Cmd):
    @auto_argument
    def do_math(self):
        """Math operations"""
        
    @do_math.add_subcommand("add")
    def add(self, x: float, y: float):
        """Addition"""
        self.poutput(f"{x} + {y} = {x + y}")
```

Usage examples:
```
(Cmd) math add 5 3
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
(Cmd) math sub 5 3
5.0 - 3.0 = 2.0
```

2. Multi-level subcommand example:

```python
from ptcmd import Cmd, auto_argument

class App(Cmd):
    @auto_argument
    def do_server(self):
        """Server management"""
        
    @do_server.add_subcommand("db")
    def db(self):
        """Database management"""
        
    @db.add_subcommand("migrate")
    def migrate(self, version: str):
        """Execute database migration"""
        self.poutput(f"Migrating to version {version}...")

    @do_server.add_subcommand("cache")
    def cache(self):
        """Cache management"""
        
    @cache.add_subcommand("clear")
    def clear(self, confirm: bool = False):
        """Clear cache"""
        if confirm:
            self.poutput("Cache cleared")
        else:
            self.poutput("Please add --confirm to proceed")
```

Usage examples:
```
(Cmd) server db migrate v1.2.0
Migrating to version v1.2.0...
(Cmd) server cache clear --confirm  
Cache cleared
```

### 4.4 Async Command Support

Native async/await support for I/O bound operations:

```python
import aiohttp
from ptcmd import Cmd, auto_argument

class AsyncApp(Cmd):
    @auto_argument
    async def do_get(self, url: str):
        """Fetch URL content"""
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url) as resp:
                self.poutput(await resp.text(), markup=False)
```
