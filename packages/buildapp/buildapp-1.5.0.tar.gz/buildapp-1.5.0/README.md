# buildapp
Cross-Platform script used to recompile APK that was decompiled by apktool <br/>
That way, you can decompile an application, patch it's smali-source / resources / manifest / libs / ... <br />
And rebuild it into a new apk you may install in your devices <br />
<br />
*NOTE* that you should use this tool for debugging / educational purposes only! <br />
*NOTE* that you must accept the LICENSE of the tools listed in the [requirements](#Requirements) section

## Installation
Simply run:
> pip install buildapp --upgrade && buildapp_fetch_tools

Make sure to have python scripts folder in your path, <br/>
And use the correct version of pip for python3

## Decompilation process
Use [`apktool`](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/) to decompile your application.

Apktool decompilation syntax:
> apktool d <apk_path> -o <output_folder>

## Patching process
Just change anything you want, native-elfs in `/lib` folder, [smali-code](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dalvik-bytecode) from smali folders, manifest file `AndroidManifest.xml`, resources, assets and whatever's out there

## Recompilation process
Simply use our tool, the syntax is:
> buildapp -d <sources_folder> -o <outout_apk>

For additional flags, ran `buildapp -h` <br/>

- apktool build
    - Use apktool to rebuild the apk from the sources folder
    - > apktool b <sources_folder> -o <output_apk>
- zip-alignment
    - apk is implemented as a zip file which should have the correct alignment in order to be installed
    - implemented using [`zipalign`](https://developer.android.com/tools/zipalign)
- obtain keystore
    - our tool will use a default keystore if you won't provide one
    - you may use [`keytool`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html) to generate your own keystores
- apk signing
    - our tool will sign the apk using the keystore mentioned above
    - implemented using [`apksigner`](https://developer.android.com/tools/apksigner)
- apk installation
    - if asked to, buildapp will install the signed apk on connected adb device (if there's only one) <br/>
    *NOTE* that if you won't provide the same keystore as the original app already installed on your device, you may not be able to install the apk you built by this script unless you'll uninstall the original app first.
    - implemented using [`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb)

And that's it! Now you have a new apk, waiting to be installed it on your android devices!

## Requirements
The project uses these tools (can be fetched using `buildapp_fetch_tools` after `pip install buildapp`):
- android SDK tools ([download build_tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/build-tools_r33-windows.zip), [download platform_tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r34.0.1-windows.zip))
    - adb (default at SDK\platform_tools, only required if `-i` flag is used)
    - zipalign (default at SDK\build_tools)
    - apksigner (default at SDK\build_tools)
- apktool [installation manual](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/)
