Kessler is a Python package for simulation-based inference and machine learning for space collision avoidance and assessment. It is named in honor of NASA scientist [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler) known for his studies regarding [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) and proposing the [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome).

Initially developed by the [FDL Europe](https://fdleurope.org/) Constellations team in collaboration with [European Space Operations Centre (ESOC)](http://www.esa.int/esoc) of the [European Space Agency (ESA)](http://www.esa.int).

## Documentation and roadmap

To get started, follow the [documentation](https://kesslerlib.github.io/kessler/) examples.

## Authors

Kessler was initiated by the Constellations team at the Frontier Development Lab (FDL) Europe 2020, a public–private partnership between the European Space Agency (ESA), Trillium Technologies, and University of Oxford. The main developer is [Giacomo Acciarini](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/team/giacomo_acciarini/).

Constellations team members: Giacomo Acciarini, Francesco Pinto, Sascha Metz, Sarah Boufelja, Sylvester Kaczmarek, Klaus Merz, José A. Martinez-Heras, Francesca Letizia, Christopher Bridges, Atılım Güneş Baydin
