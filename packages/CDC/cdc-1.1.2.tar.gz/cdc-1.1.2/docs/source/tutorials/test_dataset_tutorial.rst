Tutorial with test dataset
==========================

In this tutorial we will show how *CDCs* CLI can be used on an example dataset of pumpkins to extract the pumpkins in the orthomosaic.

The example dataset can be downloaded from Zenodo on this link: https://zenodo.org/record/8254412.

The example dataset is from a pumpkin field, where the orange pumpkins can be seen on a gray background. save the example dataset in an easy to reach location on your computer, for this tutorial we will placed it in the following directory: */home/cdc/example_dataset*.

The dataset consist of the following files:

* an orthomosaic from a pumpkin field with orange pumpkins on a brown / green field **20190920_pumpkins_field_101_and_109-cropped.tif**
* a crop of the orthomosaic **crop_from_orthomosaic.tif**
* an annotated copy of the cropped orthomosaic **crop_from_orthomosaic_annotated.tif**

To learn the color distribution, the information from the **ccrop_from_orthomosaic.tif** file is combined with the annotations in the **crop_from_orthomosaic_annotated.tif** file.

    crop_from_orthomosaic.tif

.. figure:: ../_static/pumpkins_example/crop_from_orthomosaic_annotated.png

    crop_from_orthomosaic_annotated.tif


If *CDC* is not already installed, see :doc:`installation </installation>`.

With *CDC* installed the CLI can be run with:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m CDC

or if the installation have added *CDC* to the path it can be invoked simply with:

.. code-block:: shell

    CDC

From here on out we will assume *CDC* is in the path, but if that is not the case for you replace :code:`CDC` in the following with :code:`python -m CDC`.

To create a color model from the **crop_from_orthomosaic.tif** and the **crop_from_orthomosaic_annotated.tif** files and apply it on the orthomosaic **20190920_pumpkins_field_101_and_109-cropped.tif** to calculate the color distance, use the following command in the dataset folder e.g. */home/cdc/example_dataset*:

.. code-block:: shell

    CDC 20190920_pumpkins_field_101_and_109-cropped.tif \
        crop_from_orthomosaic.tif \
        crop_from_orthomosaic_annotated.tif \
        --save_ref_pixels

This will take a little time but a progress bar will be shown.

The output is new georeferenced orthomosaic with the calculated color distances to the reference color as grayscale. Here is a small part of the orthomosaic shown, right below is the same area in the input orthomosaic.

.. figure:: ../_static/pumpkins_example/color_distance_crop.png

.. figure:: ../_static/pumpkins_example/crop_from_orthomosaic.png

In addition to generating the processed orthomosaic, the *CDC* also have exported a file **pixel_values/selected.csv** that contains all the color values of the annotated pixels. This can be used to gain a better understanding of the segmentation process. Each row corresponds to the color value of one pixel.
