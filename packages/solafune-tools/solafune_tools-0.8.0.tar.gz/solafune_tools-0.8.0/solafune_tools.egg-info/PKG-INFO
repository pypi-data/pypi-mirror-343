## Solafune-Tools: Open tools for Solafune developers and Solafune hackers where can share developed tools in geospatial data

This library package is an integrated open-source tool for Solafune developers, Solafune hackers, scientists, engineers, students, and anyone interested in geospatial data analysis. The solafune-tools contain many tools to help you develop your analysis like downloading STAC catalogs and Sentinel-2 imagery (from Planetary Computer) and then assembling it into a cloudless mosaic, competition_tools, community_tools, and other tools in geospatial data analysis. Other tools also will be added in the future.

### April 2025: Added new metrics, dependencies flexibility.

## Quickstart

Install the package using `pip` or `uv pip`, recommend using `python >= 3.10`:

```bash
uv pip install solafune_tools
```

All public-facing functions have detailed docstrings explaining their expected inputs and outputs. You can check any of them through `print(solafune_tools.function_name.__doc__)` (if you don't use print it shows as an unstructured string) or `??solafune_tools.function_name` in the jupyter notebooks.
Before using the library, you can set the directory where you want to store data by calling.

```python
solafune_tools.set_data_directory(dir_path="your_data_dir_here")
```

The above command sets the environment variable `solafune_tools_data_dir` from where all sub-modules draw their file paths. It is not set persistently (i.e., not written to `.bashrc` or similar), so you will need to put it each time you ssh into your machine or on reboot. If you do not explicitly set this, it will default to creating/using a `data` folder within your current working directory.

## Documentation

Refer to this [link](docs/README.md) for further information on each tool contained in this repository.

## Contributions
