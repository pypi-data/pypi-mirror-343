üìä Data Quality Checks
Missing Values Analysis

- Identifies columns with missing data
- Calculates the percentage of missing values in each field
- Highlights fields requiring data completion

Outlier Detection

- Uses statistical methods (IQR or Z-score)
- Identifies numerical values that significantly deviate from the norm
- Provides visual representation of outlier distribution

Data Type Consistency

- Validates that data conforms to expected types
- Identifies potential type mismatches or conversion opportunities
- Suggests appropriate data type transformations

Duplicate Detection

- Finds exact duplicate records
- Highlights columns with high duplication rates
- Calculates duplication percentages across the dataset
