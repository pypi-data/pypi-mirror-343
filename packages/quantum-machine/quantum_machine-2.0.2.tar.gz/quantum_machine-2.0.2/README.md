# Quantum Machine

**Quantum-Machine CLI** is a command-line interface developed by **QuantumDatalytica LLC** to help developers build, run, test, and manage modular analytics components called **Quantum Machines**. These machines are the foundation of scalable, distributed data workflows within the QuantumDatalytica ecosystem. The CLI streamlines local development and ensures consistent behavior across environments.

> **Note:**  
> [`quantum-core-engine`](https://github.com/QuantumDatalytica-LLC/quantum-core-engine.git) is a public dependency and must be installed manually. Please contact the QuantumDatalytica team or refer to internal documentation for setup instructions.

## 🧪 Example Commands

### 🔧 Initialize a machine

```bash
quantum init machine HelloWorld
```

Creates:
- `HelloWorld/main.py`
- `HelloWorld/Project.json`
- `HelloWorld/requirements.txt`
- `HelloWorld/Dockerfile`
- `HelloWorld/input.json`
- `HelloWorld/output.json`


---

### ▶️ Run the machine

```bash
quantum run machine HelloWorld
```

---

### 🐳 Build the machine as Docker Image

```bash
quantum build machine HelloWorld
```

Builds a Docker image with dependencies for the machine.

---

### 🧪 Test your machine

```bash
quantum test machine HelloWorld
```

Runs the test suite defined under the machine's directory.

---

### 🎯 Lint your machine

```bash
quantum lint machine HelloWorld
```

Applies flake8 or equivalent linting tools to maintain code standards.

---

### 🛡 Validate machine structure

```bash
quantum validate machine HelloWorld\<file_name>
```

Ensures the machine has the correct `Project.json`, required fields, and structure.

### 🦮 Create a Workflow

```bash
quantum init workflow my_workflow
```

Creates a `workflow.yaml` file to define machine dependencies.

---

### ➕ Add DAG Machine to Workflow

```bash
quantum add machine --name 2nd_Machine -w my_workflow
quantum add machine --name 3rd_Machine -p HelloWorld --workflow  my_workflow
quantum add machine --name 4th_Machine -parent 2nd_Machine -w my_workflow
quantum add machine --name 5th_Machine -p 3rd_Machine 4th_Machine -w my_workflow
```

---

### 🚀 Run a Workflow

```bash
quantum run workflow my_workflow
```

Executes machines in the correct DAG order as defined in `workflow.yaml`.
