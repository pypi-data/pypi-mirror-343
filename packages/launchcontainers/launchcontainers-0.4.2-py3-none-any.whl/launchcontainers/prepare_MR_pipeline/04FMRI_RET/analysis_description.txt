To run PRF analysis,

1. needs to sync all the stimuli and vistadisplog files from the local experiment PC

stimuli: the .mat file BcblViennaDisplay read
vistadisplog: follow the sub-/ses- structure, are the params.mat files


If prfprepare is point to some freesurfer dir, better to maintain it because the following prfresult will look for that

freesurfer dir needs to be under fmriprep sourcedata

fmriprep dir is hard coded, must be fmriprep/analysis-xxx


For PRFprepare, we need to have sourcedata/stimuli field

FOR PRFresult, it seems impossible to run on either IPS or DIPC
    PRFresult is need prfprepare to get the bids files etc


So in summary
move all the stimuli, vistadisplog thing to BIDS folder, run the prepare_prf_log.py, to prepare those things,

then run prfprepare and prfanalyze on DIPC

move everything back to BCBL and run the prfresult on lmc02

### IMPORTANT for PRFresult
it seems it needed a derivatives --> BIDS/derivatives folder so that prfresult can run


1. to run prf-pipelines in general, you need to prepare the vistadisplog at correct place
2. Run prfprepare there is no option to specify task
3. to have multiple sessions do this: "[02, 03, 04]" (the "" needs to be outside of the [] list)
    this is particularly for prf-analyze and prfprepare


for prfresult: both "[bar,wedge]" and ["bar", "wedge"] should be working


the code should be under: baseP/code/04b_prf
