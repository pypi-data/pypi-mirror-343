First, copy things from BCBL lab folder to VOTCLOC/dicom
then conduct the heudiconv to VOTCLOC/raw_nifti folder

The fastest way is to use IPS to launch heudiconv, I will never use DIPC because it is too slow
and it is hard to control for the QC

IF IPS is not working, try local serial, local parallel is not working

I would put subseslist_heudiconv into basedir/code, so that it is more organized
