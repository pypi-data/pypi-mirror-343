# Tool Implementation Final Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist to ensure all aspects of the tool calling implementation have been properly addressed before release.

## Core Functionality

- [ ] Tool Definition
  - [ ] All required classes and interfaces are defined
  - [ ] Function to tool definition conversion works correctly
  - [ ] JSON Schema generation for tool parameters is accurate
  - [ ] Tool validation works for various parameter types

- [ ] Provider Implementation
  - [ ] OpenAI provider fully implements tool calling
  - [ ] Anthropic provider fully implements tool calling (if applicable)
  - [ ] Other providers implement tool calling as their APIs support it
  - [ ] Providers correctly handle tool call responses
  - [ ] Tool conversion between AbstractLLM format and provider formats works correctly

- [ ] Session Implementation
  - [ ] Adding tools to sessions works correctly
  - [ ] Tool state is maintained throughout the session
  - [ ] Tool execution works correctly in sessions
  - [ ] Error handling during tool execution is robust
  - [ ] Sessions correctly pass tool calls and results between messages

- [ ] Streaming Support
  - [ ] Tool calls are correctly identified during streaming
  - [ ] Streaming can be paused for tool execution
  - [ ] Streaming resumes correctly after tool execution

## API Design

- [ ] Public API is clean and intuitive
- [ ] Method signatures are consistent
- [ ] Type hints are used throughout
- [ ] Error handling is consistent and informative
- [ ] API is backward compatible with existing code

## Integration

- [ ] Tool calling works with all supported providers
- [ ] Tool calling works with all message formats
- [ ] Tool calling works with streaming
- [ ] Tool calling works with file attachments (if applicable)
- [ ] Tool calling works with other features (e.g., vision, audio)

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Error handling testing
- [ ] Cross-provider testing
- [ ] Manual testing has been completed

## Documentation

- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Clear usage examples
- [ ] README updated with tool calling information
- [ ] In-code documentation (docstrings)
- [ ] Implementation guide for future reference

## Performance & Reliability

- [ ] Tool execution is reasonably fast
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] Error recovery is robust
- [ ] Long-running tools are handled appropriately
- [ ] Resource cleanup is reliable

## Security & Validation

- [ ] Tool arguments are validated before execution
- [ ] Unsafe tool execution is prevented
- [ ] Tool results are validated before returning
- [ ] Sensitive information is not leaked in tool arguments or results

## Project Management

- [ ] All planned phases are complete
- [ ] All GitHub issues related to tool calling are closed
- [ ] Code review has been completed
- [ ] Technical debt is documented
- [ ] Future improvements are documented

## Release Preparation

- [ ] Version number is updated
- [ ] Changelog is updated
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Documentation is published
- [ ] Upgrade guide is prepared (if needed)

## Final Review

- [ ] Core maintainers have reviewed the implementation
- [ ] All critical issues are resolved
- [ ] The implementation meets the original requirements
- [ ] The implementation is robust and production-ready

## After Release

- [ ] Monitor for issues reported by users
- [ ] Address critical bugs quickly
- [ ] Collect feedback for future improvements
- [ ] Plan for enhancements based on user feedback
