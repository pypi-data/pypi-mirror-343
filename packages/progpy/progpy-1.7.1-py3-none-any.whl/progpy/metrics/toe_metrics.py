    Args:
        toe (UncertainData or list[float]): Times of event for a single event (array[float]) or multiple events, output from predictor
        time (float): time for calculation
        **kwargs (optional): Configuration parameters. Supported parameters include:
          * n_samples (int): Number of samples to use for calculating metrics (if ToE is not UnweightedSamples). Defaults to 10,000.

    Returns:
        float: Probability of success
