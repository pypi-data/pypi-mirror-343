"""Thread-safe state management for the IdentiTwin system.

Provides global, thread-safe access to various state variables categorized into:
    - Sensor states (e.g., calibration data)
    - Event states (e.g., recording status, event count)
    - Configuration parameters (read-only access to config)
    - System operational states (e.g., running status)

Uses threading locks to ensure atomic updates and prevent race conditions
when accessed from multiple threads (e.g., acquisition, event, visualization).

Attributes:
    _sensor_state (dict): Stores sensor-related state variables.
    _event_state (dict): Stores event-related state variables.
    _config_state (dict): Stores configuration parameters.
    _system_state (dict): Stores system-wide operational states.
    _sensor_lock (threading.Lock): Lock for accessing `_sensor_state`.
    _event_lock (threading.Lock): Lock for accessing `_event_state`.
    _config_lock (threading.Lock): Lock for accessing `_config_state`.
    _system_lock (threading.Lock): Lock for accessing `_system_state`.
