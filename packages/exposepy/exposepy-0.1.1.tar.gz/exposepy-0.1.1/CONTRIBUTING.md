Clone and install dev deps:

```

## ðŸ§¾ Code Style

Use `ruff` or `black` for formatting if preferred.

## ðŸ§  Pull Request Policy

- Keep PRs focused and small.
- If adding a feature, open an issue/discussion first.
- At least **one approval** from a maintainer is required.
- We prefer clean commits over "fix typo" clutter â€” use `git rebase -i` if needed.
