# üöÄ axios-py - Features, Roadmap & Comparisons

Welcome to **axios-py** ‚Äî the next-gen Python HTTP client inspired by Axios, designed to be simple, flexible, and feature-rich. This document outlines the features, roadmap steps, and comparisons to existing libraries such as `requests`.

---

## ‚ú® **Features List**

**Core Features (v1.0.0)**
- **Promise-like Interface (Async/Await)**  
  Just like Axios in JavaScript, `axios-py` supports async/await syntax, allowing users to handle requests and responses asynchronously.

- **Unified API for Sync & Async Requests**  
  Both synchronous and asynchronous requests are supported, making it easy to choose the preferred style of handling HTTP requests.

- **Request and Response Interceptors**  
  Modify requests before sending them and handle responses globally before they're returned to the user.

- **Global & Per-Request Configuration**  
  Global defaults can be set (e.g., base URL, headers), or individual requests can override the global settings.

- **Automatic JSON Parsing**  
  Automatically parses JSON responses. No need for additional `json()` calls.

- **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff**  
  Automatically retries requests on certain errors like 5xx and 429 (rate limit exceeded), using exponential backoff.

- **Cancelable Requests (Abort Tokens)**  
  Allows for aborting requests that are no longer needed using cancel tokens, improving control over HTTP operations.

- **Timeout Control**  
  Both connection and read timeouts can be configured globally or per request to handle slow or unresponsive services.

- **File Upload/Download Progress**  
  Track the progress of large file uploads and downloads, which is useful for managing user experience during these operations.

- **Custom Status Validation**  
  Control what HTTP status codes are treated as errors. By default, anything not in the 2xx range is treated as an error.

---

**Advanced Features (v2.0+)**

- **Rate-Limiting (Automatic Throttling)**  
  Automatically throttle requests based on rate limits returned by the API, improving reliability when dealing with rate-limited endpoints.

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**  
  For scenarios where multiple requests are made to a service, the circuit breaker helps to gracefully fail when the service is down or unreachable.

- **Middleware Support**  
  Add custom logic between request/response phases, such as logging, token refreshing, etc.

- **WebSocket Support**  
  Support for WebSockets to allow real-time data streaming with ease.

- **Batching Requests**  
  Send multiple HTTP requests at once and receive responses in a batch, optimizing network calls.
