### Version 0.23.0 - PyPI release date 2024-11-18

- publishing previous change and grscheller consistency changes
  - suspect SplitEnd class needs more work, not just clean up
    - not prepared to wrap my brain around it right now
    - don't want to delay PyPI releases for other repos
    - once splitends under control, will consider a 1.0.0 release

### Version 0.22.3.0 - Preparing for a 0.23.0 PyPI release

- renamed class FTuple -> ftuple
  - ftuple now takes 0 or 1 iterables, like list and tuple do
- created factory function for original constructor use case
  - FT\[D\](\*ds: D) -> ftuple[D]

### Version 0.22.1 - PyPI release date 2024-10-20

- removed docs from repo
- docs for all grscheller namespace projects maintained
  [here](https://grscheller.github.io/grscheller-pypi-namespace-docs/).

### Version 0.22.0 - PyPI release date 2024-10-18

- Major refactoring of SplitEnd class
  - splitends is now a subpackage containing the se module
  - removed supporting classes
  - can now be empty
- grscheller.datastructures no longer uses nada as a sentinel value
  - replaced with grscheller.fp.nothingness.noValue
- made classes in nodes module less passive with better encapsulation
- compatible with:
  - grscheller.fp >= 1.0.0 < 1.01
  - grscheller.circular-array >= 3.6.1 < 3.7

### Version 0.21.1.1 - BROKEN as of 2024-10-03

- Does not work with either
  - grscheller.fp 0.3.3 (version working for 0.21.0 release)
  - grscheller.fp 0.4.0 (latest version of fp)
- Needs an upgrade
  - TODO: replace Nada with MB as was done for grscheller.fp.iterables

### Version 0.21.1.0 - mostly docstring updates 2024-09-17

- renamed module `split_ends` -> `stacks`

### Version 0.21.0 - PyPI release date 2024-08-20

- got back to a state maintainer is happy with
  - many dependencies needed updating first

### Version 0.20.5.1 - datastructures coming back together 2024-08-19

- works with all the current versions of fp and circular-array
- preparing for PyPI 0.21.0 release

### Version 0.20.5.0 - datastructures coming back together 2024-08-17

- updated to use grscheller.fp.nada instead of grscheller.untyped.nothing
  - made debugging tons easier
- updated to use all latest PyPI versions of dependencies
- three failed tests involving class SplitEnd
- putting off PyPI v1.0.0 release indefinitely
  - all dependencies need to be at v1.0+
  - need to work out SplitEnd bugs
  - still need to finalize design (need to use it!)
  - need to find good SplitEnd use case
  - other Stack variants like SplintEnd??? (shared data/node variants?)

### Version 0.20.2.0 - Going down a typing rabbit hole 2024-08-03

- updated to use grscheller.circular-array version 3.3.0 (3.2.3.0)
- updated to use grscheller.fp version 0.3.0 (0.2.3.0)
- removed grscheller.circular-array dependency from datastructures.SplitEnd
- still preparing for the 1.0.0 datastructures release
  - as I tighten up typing, I find I must do so for dependencies too
  - using `# type: ignore` is a band-aid, use `@overload` and `cast` instead
  - using `@overload` to "untype" optional parameters is the way to go
  - use `cast` only when you have knowledge beyond what the typechecker can know

### Version 0.19.0 - PyPI release date 2024-07-15

- continuing to prepare for PyPI release 1.0.0
- cleaned up docstrings for a 1.0.0 release

- considering requiring grscheller.fp as a dependency

### Version 0.18.0.0 - Beginning to prepare for PyPI release 1.0.0

- first devel version requiring circular-array 3.1.0
- still some design work to be done
- gave Class SplitEnd fold and fold1 methods
- TODO: Verify flatMap family yields results in "natural" order

### Version 0.17.0.4 - Start of effort to relax None restrictions

- have begun relaxing the requirement of not storing None as a value
  - completed for queues.py
- requires grscheller.circular-array >= 3.0.3.0
- perhaps next PyPI release will be v1.0.0 ???

### Version 0.16.0.0 - Preparing to support PEP 695 generics

- Requires Python >= 3.12
- preparing to support PEP 695 generics
  - will require Python 3.12
  - will not have to import typing for Python 3.12 and beyond
  - BUT... mypy does not support PEP 695 generics yet (Pyright does)
- bumped minimum Python version to >= 3.12 in pyproject.toml
- map methods mutating objects don't play nice with typing
  - map methods now return copies
  - THEREFORE: tests need to be completely overhauled

### Version 0.14.1.1 - Preparing to add TypeVars

- tests working with grscheller.circular-array >= 3.0.0, \<3.2
  - lots of mypy complaints
  - first version using TypeVars will be 0.15.0.0

- FTuple now supports both slicing and indexing
- more tests for FTuple
  - slicing and indexing
  - map, foldL, accumulate methods
  - flatMap, mergeMap, exhaustMap methods
- forgot to update CHANGELOG for v0.13.0 release

### Version 0.13.0 - PyPI Release date 2024-01-30

- BUG FIX: FStack reverse() method
- added more tests

### Version 0.12.0 - PyPI Release date 2024-01-14

- Package structure mature and not subject to change beyond additions
- Will endeavor to keep top level & core module names the same
- API changes will be deprecated before removed

### Version 0.11.0 - PyPI Release date 2023-12-20

- A lot of work done on class CLArray
  - probably will change its name before the next PyPI Release
    - perhaps to "ProcessArray" or "PArray"
- Keeping this release an Alpha version
  - mostly for the freedom to rename and restructure the package

### Version 0.10.17.0+ (0.11.0-RC2) - 2023-12-17

- Second release candidate - probably will become next PyPI release
  - main now development branch, release will be release branch
  - decided to drop it back to Alpha
    - making datastructures a Beta release was premature
    - classifier "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha"
  - will cut next PyPI release with Flit from release branch
  - will need to regenerate docs on release & move to main
  - things to add in main before next release
    - will not make Maybe Nothing a singleton
    - last touched CLArray refactor
    - improve CLArray test coverage
  - Things for future PYPI releases
    - inherit FTuple from Tuple (use __new__) for performance boost
    - hold off using __slots__ until I understand them better

### Version 0.10.14.2 (0.11.0-RC1) - 2023-12-11

- First release candidate - unlikely this will be the next PyPI release
  - will cut next PyPI release with Flit from main branch
  - removed docs directory before merge (docs/ will be main only)
  - things to add in main before next release
    - make Maybe Nothing a singleton (use __new__)
    - derive FTuple from Tuple (use __new__) for performance boost
    - simplify CLArray to use a Queue instead of CircularArray & iterator
    - start using __slots__ for performance boost to data structures
      - efficiency trumps extensibility
      - prevents client code adding arbitrary attributes & methods
      - smaller size & quicker method/attribute lookups
      - big difference when dealing with huge number of data structures

### Version 0.10.14.0 - commit date 2023-12-09

- Finished massive renaming & repackaging effort
  - to help with future growth in future
  - name choices more self-documenting

### Version 0.9.1 - PyPI release date: 2023-11-09

- First Beta release of grscheller.datastructures on PyPI
- Infrastructure stable
- Existing datastructures only should need API additions
- Type annotations working extremely well
- Using Pdoc3 to generate documentation on GitHub
  - see https://grscheller.github.io/datastructures/
- All iterators conform to Python language "iterator protocol"
- Improved docstrings
- Future directions:
  - Develop some "typed" containers
  - Add sequence & transverse methods to functional subpackage classes
  - Monad transformers???
  - Need to use this package in other projects to gain insight

### Version 0.8.6.0 - PyPI release date: 2023-11-05

- Finally got queue.py & stack.py inheritance sorted out
- LSP with Pyright working quite well
- Goals for next PyPI release:

    - cons and consOr
    - head and headOr

### Version 0.8.4.0 - commit date 2023-11-03

- new data structure FTuple added
  - wrapped tuple with a FP interface
  - initial minimal viable product

### Version 0.8.3.0 - commit date 2023-11-02

    - PStack (stateful) with push, pop, peak methods
    - FStack (immutable) with cons, tail, head methods
  - Dqueue renamed DQueue
  - FLarray renamed FLArray
- tests now work

### Version 0.8.0.0 - commit date 2023-10-28

- API breaking changes
  - did not find everything returning self upon mutation
- Efforts for future directions
  - decided to use pdoc3 over sphinx to generate API documentation
  - need to resolve tension of package being Pythonic and Functional

### Version 0.7.5.0 - commit date 2023-10-26

- moved pytest test suite to root of the repo
  - src/grscheller/datastructures/tests -> tests/
  - seems to be the canonical location of a test suite
- instructions to run test suite in tests/__init__.py

### Version 0.7.4.0 - PyPI release date: 2023-10-25

- More mature
- More Pythonic
- Major API changes
- Still tagging it an Alpha release

### Version 0.7.2.0 - commit date 2023-10-18

- Queue & Dqueue no longer return Maybe objects
  - Neither store None as a value
  - Now safe to return None for non-existent values
    - like popping or peaking from an empty queue or dqueue

### Version 0.7.0.0 - commit date 2023-10-16

- added Queue data structure representing a FIFO queue
- renamed two Dqueue methods
  - headR -> peakLastIn
  - headL -> peakNextOut
- went ahead and removed Stack head method
  - fair since I still labeling releases as alpha releases
  - the API is still a work in progress
- updated README.md
  - foreshadowing making a distinction between
    - objects "sharing" their data -> FP methods return copies
    - objects "contain" their data -> FP methods mutate object
  - added info on class Queue

### Version 0.6.9.0 - PyPI release date: 2023-10-09

- deprecated Stack head() method
  - replaced with peak() method
- renamed core module to iterlib module
  - library just contained functions for manipulating iterators
  - TODO: use mergeIters as a guide for an iterator "zip" function
- class Stack better in alignment with:
  - Python lists
    - more natural for Stack to iterate backwards starting from head
    - removed Stack's __getitem__ method
    - both pop and push/append from end
  - Dqueue which wraps a Circle instance
    - also Dqueue does not have a __getitem__ method
  - Circle which implements a circular array with a Python List
  - Stack now implements map, flatMap, mergeMap methods
    - each returns a new Stack instance, with new nodes

### Version 0.6.8.6 - commit date: 2023-10-08

- 3 new methods for class Circle and Dqueue
  - mapSelf, flatMapSelf, mergeMapSelf
    - these correspond to map, flatMap, mergeMap
    - except they act on the class objects themselves, not new instances
- these new methods will NOT be added to the Stack class
  - they would destroy node sharing
  - did add a map method which returns a new instance (with new nodes)
  - TODO: add flatMap and mergeMap methods
- probably will add them to the Dqueue class too
  - not worth the maintenance effort maintaining two version of Dqueue
    - one returning new instances
    - the other modifying the object in place

### Version 0.6.8.3 - commit date: 2023-10-06

- Stack now works with Python Reversed builtin function
  - using a __reversed__ method which is O(n)
  - never figured out why reversed() failed with __getitems__ & __len__
    - this would have been O(n^2) anyway
- Stack no longer implements the __getitems__ method
- class Carray renamed to Circle
  - implements a circular array based on a Python List
  - resizes itself as needed
  - will handle None values being pushed and popped from it
  - implemented in the grscheller.datastructures.circle module
    - in the src/grscheller/datastructures/circle.py file
  - O(1) pushing/popping to/from either end
  - O(1) length determination
  - O(1) indexing for setting and getting values.
- Dqueue implemented with Circle class instead of List class directly
- Ensured that None is never pushed to Stack & Dqueue objects

### Version 0.6.4.1 - commit date: 2023-10-01

- Initial prototypes for map and flatMap for Dqueue class
- Started grscheller.datastructures.core module
  - used for grscheller.datastructures implementation
  - no particular need to indicate them to be \_private
  - exports the following functions so far
    - concatIters - sequentially concatenate multiple iterators
    - mergeIters - merge multiple iterators until one is exhausted
    - mapIter - lazily map a function over an iterator stream
- Decided to keep Alpha for next PyPI release

### Version 0.6.3.2 - commit date: 2023-09-30

- Made functional module into a sub package of datastructures
- Improved comments and type annotations
- Removed isEmpty method from Dqueue class
- Both Dqueue & Stack objects evaluate true when non-empty
- Beginning preparations for the next PyPI release
  - Want to make next PyPI release a Beta release
  - Need to improve test suite first

- data structures now support a much more FP style for Python
  - implemented Maybe monad
  - introduces the use of type annotations for this effort
  - much better test coverage

### Version 0.5.0.0 - commit date: 2023-09-20

- begin work on a more functional approach
  - create a monadic Option class
  - drop the subclassing of NONE
  - put this effort on a new branch: feature_maybe
- some flaws with previous approach
  - the OO redirection not best
    - for a class used in computationally intense contexts
    - adds way too much complexity to the design
  - some Python library probably already implemented this
    - without looking, these probably throw tons of exceptions
    - more fun implementing it myself
      - then being dissatisfied with someone else's design

### Version 0.4.0.0 - commit date: 2023-09-11

- subtle paradigm shift for Stack class
  - empty Stacks no longer returned for nonexistent stacks
    - like the tail of an empty stack
    - singleton Stack.stackNONE class object returned instead
  - Stack & \_StackNONE classes inherit from \_StackBase
  - still working out the API
