# lobmp

Limit Order Book Message Processor is a Python package designed to transform raw lseg(aka Refinitiv) high frequency trading data into convinient formats such as parquet.

## Install
The package is available through PyPi
```sh
pip install lobmp
```

## Features
The package is intended to be used as a Command Line Interface (CLI) program. The main features are
- CLI for processing message files
- Supports LSEG (also known as Refinitiv) provider (with potential for future expansion)
- Outputs data in `part-*` Parquet format
- Adjustable verbosity for logging

Please keep in mind this a package under development, so bugs are expected and functionality is not guaranteed to be 100% correct.

## Usage
```sh
lobmp <filepath> <targetdir> [--verbose LEVEL]
```
Required Arguments
- `filepath`: Path to the CSV file to be processed.
- `targetdir`: Directory where the processed file will be saved.
Optional Arguments
- `--verbose`: Logging level. Choose from: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` or `NOTSET` (default)

For example
```sh
lobmp raw_messages.csv ./output --verbose DEBUG
```
Will process the `raw_messages.csv` file and output the processed messages in the `output` folder.
