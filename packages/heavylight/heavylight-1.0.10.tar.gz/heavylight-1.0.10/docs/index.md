# Getting started

Heavylight is a lightweight Python library that allows you to run heavy modeling workloads using a familiar recursive syntax.

## Installation

```bash
pip install heavylight
```

Requires Python 3.8+

## Quick example

Models are defined by subclassing from `heavylight.Model`

```python
from heavylight import Model

class Annuity(Model):
    def t(self, t):
        return t

    def expected_claim(self, t):
        return self.number_alive(t) * self.data["annuity_per_period"]

    def number_alive(self, t):
        if t == 0:
            return self.data["initial_policies"]
        else:
            return self.number_alive(t - 1) - self.deaths(t - 1)
    
    def deaths(self, t):
        return self.number_alive(t) * self.mortality_rate(t)

    def mortality_rate(self, t):
        return self.basis["q_x"](t)
```

We can define data as a dictionary (heavylight can use any storage mechanism)

```python
policy_data = {
    "initial_policies": 10,
    "annuity_per_period": 55,
}
```

We likely need a basis too, heavylight includes a `Table` class for storing tables, but for this example we will define a mortality function directly, and store it in a basis:

```python
def q_x(t):
    return 0.02*2.64**(0.04 * (t + 30)) + 0.002

basis = {
    'q_x':q_x,
}
```

Pulling it all together, we run a projection and store it in a variable `model`

```python
model = Annuity(data = policy_data,
                basis = basis,
                proj_len = 40,
                )
```

We can query individual results:

```python
model.expected_claim(5)
```

Output: `379.7484060121289`

We can view results as a DataFrame:

```python
model_cashflows = model.df
model_cashflows.head()
```

Output:

|    |   t |   deaths |   expected_claim |   mortality_rate |   number_alive |
|---:|----:|---------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|---------------:|
|  0 |   0 | 0.661143 |          550     |        0.0661143 |       10       |
|  1 |   1 | 0.641139 |          513.637 |        0.0686529 |        9.33886 |
|  2 |   2 | 0.620078 |          478.374 |        0.071292  |        8.69772 |
|  3 |   3 | 0.598033 |          444.27  |        0.0740356 |        8.07764 |
|  4 |   4 | 0.575091 |          411.378 |        0.0768878 |        7.47961 |


# Loading from Templates / Examples

Heavylight includes some examples - note that this function doesn't form part of the API and is subject to change.  These are purely to give an example of how to define models and tables, and are not for direct production use.

```python
import heavylight

# an example protection model
heavylight.make_example(download_to_path='examples', example_name='protection')

#Â install a small minimal template
heavylight.make_example(download_to_path='examples', example_name='template')
```

Once run, these will appear in the `examples` folder relative to where the script was run.

The protection model contains three different ways of running it (single policy, using numpy arrays, and using numpy arrays with memory optimisation).  The folder also contains an Excel spreadsheet which replicates the calculation.
