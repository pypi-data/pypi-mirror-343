    A class that is an enumeration of available statistics that may be retrieved from any class with
    the py:class:`solace.messaging.utils.manageable.Manageable` interface.

    These metrics are a composite of native library metrics and Python API metrics.  They will not
    always reflect the application experience.  For example an application may publish some number of
    messages and not see that number in TOTAL_MESSAGES_SENT because this reflects messages sent to the
    broker and not messages that may still be queued within the Python API for sending.

    When analyzing metrics therefore the developer should be aware of all the places messages and or
    event may be counted.
