    An abstract class that defines the interface to a persistent message receiver.

    Note:
        A caller of any of blocking message receiving methods , those without the *async* suffix such as the
        :py:func:`PersistentMessageReceiver.receive_message()<solace.messaging.receiver.persistent_message_receiver.PersistentMessageReceiver.receive_message()>`,
        method will receive a new message for each call.

    WARNING:
        When you use this class, these are some considerations to aware of:

        - Concurrent use of asynchronous and synchronous message receiving methods on a single instance of
          receiver can have some unintended side effects and should be avoided.

        - Asynchronous methods should NOT be called multiple times or in combination with blocking message
          receiving function on the same :py:class:`solace.messaging.receiver.message_receiver.MessageReceiver`
          instance to avoid any unintended side effects.

        - After a broker initiated termination has occurred, PersistentMessageReceiver.ack would raise and exception.
          This behavior can occur before the TerminateEvent is pushed to the application via the handler.
          Termination Notification Event is dispatched on termination triggered by flow down or flow session down event.
