    """
    A class that abstracts configuration of back-pressure features
    All methods in this class are mutually exclusive and therefore should be called only once.

    The default back-pressure configuration is to internally handle back pressure. This is equivalent
    to on_back_pressure_elastic().

        """
        Configures the receiver to buffer indefinitely, consuming as much memory as required for buffered messages.
        On memory exhaustion receiver behaviour is undefined. Elastic, essentially no, back-pressure is an ideal
        strategy for applications that process received messages at a low rate with infrequent small bursts of
        activity.
        It should not be considered for use in all cases.

        Returns:
            DirectReceiverBackPressureConfiguration: An instance of itself for method chaining.

        receiving messages, the incoming message will be discarded. The maximum capacity of the buffer is given
        by the parameter of this method, ``buffer_capacity``.
