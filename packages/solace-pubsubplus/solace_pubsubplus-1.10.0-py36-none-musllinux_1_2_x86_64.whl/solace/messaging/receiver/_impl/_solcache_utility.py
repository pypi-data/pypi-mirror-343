    # NOTE:
    # SOL-42602(2023-09-22):
    # Currently, this method is only used when an error is encountered while trying to send a cache request
    # (see _on_publishable_send_error in _direct_message_receiver.py for details). Based on the implementation
    # at this time, the only error that should be picked up on that code path is a PubSubPlusCoreClientError.
    # while that error would contain a stringified version of the error info from the core library, and the
    # error subcode accessible as an attribute, the return code of the error is not accessible through an
    # attribute. The _SolCacheEventInfo that is generated below requires information from the _CacheRequester,
    # as well as an error return code and error subcode. Therefore, if the _SolCacheEventInfo were to be
    # informed by a PubSubPlusCoreClientError, we could copy the subcode, but could not copy the return code.
    # Instead, we would have to generate the return code which could cause confusion since the two codes might
    # not match a possible combination of codes.
    #
    # The alternative, which is currently implemented, is to generate both the return code and subcode, so that
    # the combination is at least guaranteed to be consistent, and since all options require some form of generation
    # anyways. The implemented option is permissible because of several implementation details:
    #
    #
    # 1. As previously stated, this function is called from only one place, which cannot pass the return code
    # without significant change to several interfaces, including the Publishable interface, and would also break
    # the systemic pattern of error handling in the API.
    #
    #
    # 2. The return code and subcode of a _SolCacheEventInfo, in the current implementation and when directly
    # accessed, are only used to determine which CacheRequestOutcome to pass to the application
    # (see process_cache_event in _direct_message_receiver.py for details).
    #
    # 2.a. It is coincidence of the architecture that any of the subcodes and return codes that can be returned as a
    # part of a failure to send a cache request are presented to the application as the same
    # CacheRequestOutcome.FAILED. Without this coincidence, if the API were required to discern between different
    # kinds of send failures, the current implementation would not work.
    #
    # 2.b. Another function in this file, generate_exception_from_cache_event, could hypothetically be used
    # to generate an error from a _SolCacheEventInfo, which itself had been generated from this function. This
    # would be erroneous since the return code and subcode contained within the generated error are presented to the
    # application, and provide useful information. However, currently the generate_exception_from_cache_event function
    # is only used in the _cache_event_callback method (see _direct_message_receiver.py for details) to generate an
    # error from a _SolCacheEventInfo, which itself has been generated from a core library SolCacheEventInfo struct.
    #
    # TL;DR: There isn't really a TL;DR, because you need to read all of the above cases and ensure that either they
    # do not change; or, if any of them do, that this function is reviewed and changed as necessary.
