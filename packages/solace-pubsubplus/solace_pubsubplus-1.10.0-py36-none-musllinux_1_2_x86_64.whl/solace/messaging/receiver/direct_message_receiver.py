    An abstract class that defines the interface to a PubSub+ direct message consumer/receiver.

    NOTE:
        A caller of any of blocking message receiving methods , those without the *async* suffix such as the
        :py:func:`solace.messaging.receiver.message_receiver.MessageReceiver.receive_message()` function.
        will receive a new message for each call.

    WARNING:
        When you use this class, these are some considerations to aware of:

        - Concurrent use of asynchronous and synchronous message receiving methods on a single instance of
          receiver can have some unintended side effects and should be avoided.

        - Asynchronous methods should NOT be called multiple times or in combination with blocking message
          receiving function on the same  :py:class:`solace.messaging.receiver.message_receiver.MessageReceiver`
          object to avoid any unintended side effects.
