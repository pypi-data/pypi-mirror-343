 This module contains a builder for the transactional message receivers.
 Applications that need to receive messages on a transacted session
 must first create a  ``TrannsactionalMessageReceiverBuilder``
 using the
 :py:meth:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.TransactionalMessagingService.create_transactional_receiver_builder()`.

 The ``TransactionalMessageReceiverBuilder`` then creates one or more
 ``TransactionalMessageReceiver`` instances as needed.
