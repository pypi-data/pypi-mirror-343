        Requests messages from a broker which were previously cached using PubSub+ Cache. Responses to this request are
        processed by the given :py:class:`CacheRequestOutcomeListener<solace.messaging.utils.cache_request_outcome_listener.CacheRequestOutcomeListener>`.
        The `cache_request_id` parameter is used for correlating requests with responses. It is the application's
        responsibility to guarantee that only unique integers are provided to this field, so as to avoid collisions.

        Args:
            cached_message_subscription_request(CachedMessageSubscriptionRequest): Request
                for cached messages matching specified subscription and other fulfillment
                criteria.
            cache_request_id(int): request identifier which can be used for response
                callback correlation purposes, this value needs to be unique for the time
                of the application execution. A valid cache_request_id is within the range of 0 to Unsigned 64 int max.
                This value will be returned on a
                :py:meth:`on_completion()<solace.messaging.utils.correlating_completion_listener.CacheRequestOutcomeListener.on_completion>`
                callback of the
                :py:class:`CacheRequestOutcomeListener<solace.messaging.utils.correlating_completion_listener.CacheRequestOutcomeListener>`.
                The same value will be returned.
            completion_listener(CacheRequestOutcomeListener): Request completion listener
                to be notified when cache request is completed.

        Raises:
            PubSubPlusClientException: If the operation could not be performed.
            IllegalStateException: If the service is not connected or the receiver is not running.
