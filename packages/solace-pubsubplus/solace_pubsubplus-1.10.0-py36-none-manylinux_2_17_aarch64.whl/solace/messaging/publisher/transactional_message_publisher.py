This module contains the TramsactionalMessagePublisher class.

A transactional message publisher must be created using
:py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.transactional_message_publisher_builder.TransactionalMessagePublisherBuilder`. The
TransactionalMessagePublisher instance is used to publish messages created by a
:py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.outbound_message.OutboundMessageBuilder` on the transacted session.
The topic (or destination)
can be added when the message is a published.

The transactional message publisher may also be used to publish simple messages
containing only a bytearray or string payload.
