  This key may be used in the :py:class:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingService` properties

  This property dictates how many times to try to connect to the PubSub+ broker

  Zero means no automatic connection retries (that is, try once and give up). -1 means try to connect forever. 
  The default valid range is value that is greater than or equal to -1.

  When using a host list, each time the API works through the host list without establishing a connection is
  considered a connect retry. For example, if a CONNECTION_RETRIES value of two is used,
  the API could possibly work through all of the listed hosts without connecting to them three times: one time
  through for the initial connect attempt, and then two times through for connect retries.
  Each connect retry begins with the first host listed. After each unsuccessful attempt to connect to a host,
  the API waits for the amount of time set for RECONNECTION_ATTEMPTS_WAIT_INTERVAL before attempting
  another connection to a host, and the number times to attempt to connect to one host before moving on to the
  next listed host is determined by the value set for CONNECTION_RETRIES_PER_HOST.
