PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL = "solace.messaging.service.payload-compression-level"
"""Property constant defining the key for payload compression.

  This key may be used in the :py:class:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingService` properties when configured from a dictionary.

  Valid values for the payload compression level to be applied to the payload of a message published by a client are 0-9.

  Value meanings:
  0 - "disable payload compression" (the default)
  1 - least amount of compression and the fastest data throughput
  9 - most compression and slowest data throughput

  The payload compression value should be adjusted according to particular network requirements and the performance required.

  Note: Please ensure that both publishers and consumers are updated to support payload compression before enabling this property.
  In the case where a publisher compresses the payload and a consumer does not support payload decompression, the untouched compressed message
  will be received which can lead to potential issues within the consuming application. Therefore, the consumer would either need to update
  to a newer version of the API or the user would need to handle the decompression on the receiving side in their own application.
  If a publishing application is able to send a compressed message, the broker's treatment of message-type will vary depending on the protocol.
  Lastly, do not enable payload compression when sending cache-requests. Applications that are sending cache-requests and receiving cache-responses
  may end up getting compressed messages that they are not able to handle.
