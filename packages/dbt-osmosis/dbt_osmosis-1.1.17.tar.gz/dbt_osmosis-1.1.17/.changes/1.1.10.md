## 1.1.10 - 2025-01-29
### Added
* Match on corresponding node when passing yaml file path(s) in positional selectors ie like with pre-commit
* Initial support for versioned model inheritance and operations
* Position filepath arguments pointed directly at YAML files will select all the nodes associated with the yaml file allowing better pre-commit function
### Changed
* Relax ruamel.yaml version constraint
* Superseded makefile with taskfile as first step to have 1:1 parity and consistency between CI with local testing -- an interesting use of uv (like nox)
### Removed
* Remove requirements.txt, just use uv
