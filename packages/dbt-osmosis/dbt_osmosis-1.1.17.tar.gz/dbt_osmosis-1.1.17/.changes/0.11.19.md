## 0.11.19 - 2023-05-11
### Added
* You can now skip columns being added to yaml files by default via flag. Useful if you have massive sources and are purposefully not documenting much of them. The flag is called --skip-add-columns on all yaml subcommands.
### Changed
* Relaxed python contraint to include py311
### Fixed
* Fixed case sensitivity in snowflake during column reordering
