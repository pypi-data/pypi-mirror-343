# image-upscaling.net API Client

A simple Python package to interact with the free [image-upscaling.net](https://image-upscaling.net/online_tts) text to speech API.

## Features

- **Submit Text**: Send text to the tts service with selected voice and speed (visit the website for voices and character limit).
- **Query Status**: Retrieve the processing status of your requests. This will give you the urls to download processed mp3 files.

```python

```

#### Parameters:
- `client_id` (str): Your 32-digit hexadecimal client ID.
- `text` (str): Your text to process
- `voice` (str): Select a voice
- `speed` (float): set output speed

### Querying Processing Status

The `get_status` function retrieves the status of your requests.

```python
from text_to_speech_api import get_status
results = get_status(client_id)
```

#### Returns:
a list of (id, output_path) for your requests
