## Features

- Specialized Simply Hired job scraping implementation
- Advanced anti-bot detection using PhantomPlaywrightScraper
- Headless browser automation with Playwright
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Clean job data extraction and transformation

## Installation

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install pudim-hunter-driver-simply-hired
```

### For Development
```bash
git clone git@github.com:luismr/pudim-hunter-driver-simply-hired.git
cd pudim-hunter-driver-simply-hired
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
from pudim_hunter_driver.models import JobQuery
from pudim_hunter_driver_simply_hired import SimplyHiredJobDriver

# Initialize the driver
driver = SimplyHiredJobDriver()

# Create a job search query
query = JobQuery(
    keywords="software engineer",
    location="San Francisco",
    page=1,
    items_per_page=20
)

# Fetch jobs
job_list = driver.fetch_jobs(query)
for job in job_list.jobs:
    print(f"{job.title} at {job.company}")
```

### Anti-Bot Detection

The SimplyHiredJobDriver uses PhantomPlaywrightScraper internally to implement advanced anti-bot detection measures, ensuring reliable scraping from Simply Hired. This includes:

- Browser fingerprint randomization
- Stealth mode configurations
- Automated request pattern variation
- Advanced header management
