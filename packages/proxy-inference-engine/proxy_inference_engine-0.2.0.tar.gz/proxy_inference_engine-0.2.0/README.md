The **Proxy Inference Engine (PIE)** is the inference engine developed by The Proxy Company, built upon the foundation of Apple's [MLX framework](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx). 

It is designed for high-performance inference of language models (including VLMs) on Apple Silicon hardware.

This engine is the successor to the experimental `mlx-proxy` repository (now archived).

## Installation

```bash
pip install proxy-inference-engine
```

*Note: Requires Python 3.12+ and macOS with Apple Silicon hardware.*
