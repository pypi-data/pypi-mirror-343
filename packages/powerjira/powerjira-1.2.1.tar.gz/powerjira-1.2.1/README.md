# **powerjira**
*Get rid of the guff, because tickets should be simple.*

<br />

## **Welcome to powerjira!**
Put plainly, I don't enjoy my time in the Jira GUI. There's too much crap I don't care about, and even when you make your own ticket dashboard via JQL, the ticket views themselves could stand to be more minimal. \
And that's where *powerjira* comes in ‚òïü§è

Open a minimal set of configuration files, whose location you control (defaults to `$HOME`), and interface with Jira in your favorite editor. It also offers an ergonomic way to manage watched tickets, and allows you to query tickets on key or status without having to remember JQL (because who wants that).

If you want to make tickets without the guff, I'm a `pip install` away!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è For further configuration options, see the [sleepyconfig](#sleepyconfig) section at the bottom.

<br />

## **Get Started üöÄ**

Export the following environment variables powerjira expects to be available for authentication:
```sh
export JIRA_DOMAIN=https://acme.atlassian.net
export JIRA_USERNAME=dingus@acme.com
export JIRA_TOKEN=abc123
```

Then:
```sh
pip install powerjira
pip install --upgrade powerjira

python -m powerjira --help
python -m powerjira init # stubs config if missing, opens in editor
```

<br />

## **Usage ‚öô**

For convenience, set some macro in your shell like:
```sh
alias pj='python -m powerjira'
```

Now the terminal is your ticketing interface:
```st
pj goto # opens config in editor

pj fetch QA-123 # shows ticket
pj "to do" # shows all your tickets
pj make # reads specs from your config
pj watched prune # un-watches all your 'DONE' watched tickets
pj watched list
```

<br />

## **SleepyConfig**

You can personalize a few aspects of powerjira's behavior via a file strictly named `~/.sleepyconfig/params.yml`. Paste the following into said file, and tinker to your liking:
```yml
subprocess_shell: /bin/zsh # this one is global for all sleepytools
pj_table_style: 'rounded_outline'
```

All other *sleepytools* use this file as well. Browse [my PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/sleepyboy/) if you're interested!
