              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Documentation

Check out full documentation [here](https://docs.lmnr.ai/index-agent/getting-started)

## Index API

The easiest way to use Index in production is via the [serverless API](https://docs.lmnr.ai/laminar-index/introduction). Index API manages remote browser sessions, agent infrastructure and [browser observability](https://docs.lmnr.ai/laminar-index/tracing). To get started, [sign up](https://lmnr.ai/sign-in) and create project API key. Read the [docs](https://docs.lmnr.ai/laminar-index/introduction) to learn more.

### Install Laminar
```bash
pip install lmnr
```

### Use Index via API
```python
from lmnr import Laminar, LaminarClient
# you can also set LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY environment variable

# Initialize tracing
Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="your_api_key")

# Initialize the client
client = LaminarClient(project_api_key="your_api_key")

for chunk in client.agent.run(
    stream=True,
    model_provider="gemini",
    model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25",
    prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com, find a post about AI, and summarize it"
):
    print(chunk)
    
```
## Local Quick Start

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install lmnr-index

# Install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Setup model API keys

Setup your model API keys in `.env` file in your project root:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```


### Run the agent with CLI

You can run Index via interactive CLI. It features:
- Browser state persistence between sessions
- Follow-up messages with support for "give human control" action
- Real-time streaming updates
- Beautiful terminal UI using Textual

You can run the agent with the following command. Remember to set API key for the selected model in the `.env` file.
```bash
index run
```

Output will look like this:

```
Loaded existing browser state
╭───────────────────── Interactive Mode ─────────────────────╮
│ Index Browser Agent Interactive Mode                       │
│ Type your message and press Enter. The agent will respond. │
│ Press Ctrl+C to exit.                                      │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Choose an LLM model:
1. Gemini 2.5 Flash
2. Claude 3.7 Sonnet
3. OpenAI o4-mini
Select model [1/2] (1): 3
Using OpenAI model: o4-mini
Loaded existing browser state

Your message: go to lmnr.ai, summarize pricing page

Agent is working...
Step 1: Opening lmnr.ai
Step 2: Opening Pricing page
Step 3: Scrolling for more pricing details
Step 4: Scrolling back up to view pricing tiers
Step 5: Provided concise summary of the three pricing tiers
```

### Running with a personal Chrome instance

You can use Index with personal Chrome browser instance instead of launching a new browser. Main advantage is that all existing logged in sessions will be available.

```bash
# Basic usage with default Chrome path
index run --local-chrome

# With custom Chrome path and debugging port
index run --local-chrome --chrome-path="/path/to/chrome" --port=9223
```

This will launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled and connect Index to it.

#### OS-specific Chrome paths

Default Chrome executable paths on different operating systems:

**macOS**:
```bash
index run --local-chrome --chrome-path="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
```

**Windows**:
```bash
index run --local-chrome --chrome-path="C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

#### Connecting to an already running Chrome instance

If you already have Chrome running with remote debugging enabled, you can connect to it:

1. Launch Chrome with debugging enabled:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
   
   # Windows
   "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```

2. Then run Index with the same port:
   ```bash
   index run --local-chrome --port=9222
   ```

### Run the agent with code
```python
import asyncio
from index import Agent, AnthropicProvider

async def main():

    llm = AnthropicProvider(
            model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
            enable_thinking=True, 
            thinking_token_budget=2048)
    # llm = OpenAIProvider(model="o4-mini") you can also use OpenAI models

    agent = Agent(llm=llm)

    output = await agent.run(
        prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com, find a post about AI, and summarize it"
    )
    
    print(output.result)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Stream the agent's output
```python
async for chunk in agent.run_stream(
    prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com, find a post about AI, and summarize it"
):
    print(chunk)
``` 

### Enable browser agent observability

To trace Index agent's actions and record browser session you simply need to initialize Laminar tracing before running the agent.

```python
from lmnr import Laminar

Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="your_api_key")
```

Then you will get full observability on the agent's actions synced with the browser session in the Laminar platform.

### Run with remote CDP url
```python
import asyncio
from index import Agent, AnthropicProvider, BrowserConfig

async def main():
    # Configure browser to connect to an existing Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(
        cdp_url="<cdp_url>"
    )
    
    llm = AnthropicProvider(model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", enable_thinking=True, thinking_token_budget=2048)
    
    agent = Agent(llm=llm, browser_config=browser_config)
    
    output = await agent.run(
        prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com and find the top story"
    )
    
    print(output.result)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Run with local Chrome instance (programmatically)
```python
import asyncio
from index import Agent, AnthropicProvider, BrowserConfig

async def main():
    # Configure browser to connect to a local Chrome instance
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(
        cdp_url="http://localhost:9222"
    )
    
    llm = AnthropicProvider(model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", enable_thinking=True, thinking_token_budget=2048)
    
    agent = Agent(llm=llm, browser_config=browser_config)
    
    output = await agent.run(
        prompt="Navigate to news.ycombinator.com and find the top story"
    )
    
    print(output.result)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Customize browser window size
```python
import asyncio
from index import Agent, AnthropicProvider, BrowserConfig

async def main():
    # Configure browser with custom viewport size
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(
        viewport_size={"width": 1200, "height": 900}
    )
    
    llm = AnthropicProvider(model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219")
    
    agent = Agent(llm=llm, browser_config=browser_config)
    
    output = await agent.run(
        "Navigate to a responsive website and capture how it looks in full HD resolution"
    )
    
    print(output.result)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
