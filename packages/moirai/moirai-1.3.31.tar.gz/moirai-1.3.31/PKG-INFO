# moirai

Moirai is the backend for the platform. It is developed as part of my scientific
initiation project, named Plataformas de baixo custo para controle de processos
(low-cost platform for process control), developed at CEFET-MG (Brazil) under
the supervision of Prof. Dr. Valter Leite. The project was developed through a
FAPEMIG scholaship.

It's meant to be installed in a computer near the plant, so it can be
remote-controlled by [Lachesis](https://github.com/acristoffers/Lachesis). It
exposes a RESTful API that let's you configure the hardware, save tests and
controllers, execute them and fetch the results in real-time or after the
execution finishes.

Controllers for this platform are written in Python 3 and can use any librarie
available in the computer where _moirai_ is running. It already depends on NumPy
and SciPy, as they are commonly used. This platform manages the hardware
interfacing through the [ahio](https://github.com/acristoffers/ahio) libray, so
extending it's hardware capabilities is a question of extending AHIO, which
should be simple. Execution time, sampling time, input querying and output
updating is managed by the application and let's you focus on your
controller/model.

## Installation

Use pip to install. This is a Python 3 application and won't run in Python 2.
Use `pip install moirai` or `pip3 install moirai` to install it. It also has
other dependencies not installable through pip, which can be installed by
running `moirai --install --sudo`. It will install MongoDB (or MySQL on
Raspberry Pi) and the Snap7 library. It's designed to work on Windows, macOS
(with Homebrew) and Linux (apt-get, dnf, yum and zypper).

If using the Snap7 driver on Windows, you may need to compile the driver
yourself and copy it to /Windows/System32.

On macOS, using Homebrew, you can install with:

```bash
brew tap acristoffers/repo
brew install moirai
```
