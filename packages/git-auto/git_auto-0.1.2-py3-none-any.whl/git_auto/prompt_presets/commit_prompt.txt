Generate a Git commit message following the Conventional Commits specification (v1.0.0) based *strictly* on the actions shown in the provided Git Diff.
Focus ONLY on summarizing WHAT was added, removed, or changed in the diff lines.
Note: Sensitive data might be replaced with placeholders (e.g., IP-1, example-2.com).

--- Project Context ---
{repo_context}

{file_context}

GIT DIFF:
{processed_diff}

--- Instructions ---
1.  **Format:** Adhere strictly to the Conventional Commits format:
    `<type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]`
2.  **Type Selection Guidance:**
    *   `feat`: Adding a new resource, feature, or capability.
    *   `fix`: Correcting a bug or error in existing code/configuration.
    *   `chore`: Maintenance, configuration changes, tuning, updates (e.g., adjusting intervals, adding resources for management).
    *   `refactor`: Restructuring code/config without changing external behavior.
    *   `docs`, `style`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`: As appropriate.
    *   **Choose `chore` or `feat` over `fix` for configuration adjustments or additions unless correcting a clear error.**
3.  **Scope (Optional):** Infer a relevant scope (e.g., `infrastructure`, `staging`, `kustomization`) if appropriate from file paths or content.
4.  **Description:** Write a concise summary (max 50 chars) describing the *primary action* taken in the diff (e.g., "Increase staging interval", "Add infra-namespace Kustomization"). Use imperative mood. Do not end with a period.
5.  **Body (Optional):** Briefly explain WHAT was changed based *only* on the diff lines. Avoid justifications or repeating validation points. Separate from the description with a blank line.
6.  **Footer (Optional):** Use for breaking changes or referencing issues.
7.  **Output:** Generate ONLY the raw commit message text, without any additional explanations, comments, or markdown formatting like ```.

--- Example ---
chore(infrastructure): adjust staging reconciliation intervals

Increase interval for infra-configs Kustomization to 2h.
Increase retryInterval to 2m.
Add Kustomization for infra-namespace.
