# mujoco-scenes

This package contains a collection of utility functions for generating different types of scenes in Mujoco.

## Usage

To load a robot into a particular scene, you can use the following code:

```python
from mujoco_scenes.mjcf import load_mjmodel

model = load_mjmodel("path/to/robot.xml", "smooth")

# To view the model, you can use:
mujoco.viewer.launch(model)
```
