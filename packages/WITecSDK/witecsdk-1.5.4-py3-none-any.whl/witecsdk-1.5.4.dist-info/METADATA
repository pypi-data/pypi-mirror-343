This package enables control of WITec microscopes over its COM interface (additonal license required).

- Gives access to data acquisition functions
- Implements all classes of WITec's COM interface
- Offers ready-to-use modules for main measurement modes (Large Area Scan, Line Scan, Slow Series)
- Has modules for hardware control (motorized xy and z stage, spectrograph, laser, TrueSurface, polarization, turret)
- Gives access to video system (image acquisition, autofocus)
- Enables to save and create projects
- Can be extended by directly accessing needed parameters
- All modules are tested with versions down to WITec Control 5.0 (can be used even for older version but not all classes might work)

# Documentation and examples

Basic information can be found using the Python's built-in help function.

## Quickstart

```
from WITecSDK import WITecControl
WC = WITecControl()
WC.SingleSpectrum.IntegrationTime
```

All available modules are implemented as property of the main class (WITecControl).

## Examples

Documented examples are delivered with WITec Control. Further information can be found in it's help. If you use an older version of WITec Control please contact the [WITec support team](https://raman.oxinst.com/contact).
