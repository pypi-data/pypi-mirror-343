"""
callbacks.py
------------

This module provides a set of training callbacks for the SBA Network (Sparse Biological-inspired Adaptive Network) library.  
Callbacks allow custom behavior to be applied during training, such as stopping early when no improvement is detected, saving the best model, or adjusting the learning rate dynamically.

Classes:
    - EarlyStopping: Stops training when the validation loss stops improving.
    - ModelCheckpoint: Saves the model at its best performance during training.
    - LearningRateScheduler: Adjusts the learning rate based on a user-defined schedule.

Functions:
    - get_callback(name, **kwargs): Dynamically retrieves a callback instance by name with specified parameters.

Dictionary:
    - callbacks: A registry of available callback class references for flexible instantiation.

The `sbanetwork` library emphasizes modular, flexible, and biologically inspired neural network construction.  
The `callbacks.py` module offers essential training-time utilities for better control, adaptability, and efficiency during learning. It supports regression and classification use-cases and integrates seamlessly with custom training loops.
