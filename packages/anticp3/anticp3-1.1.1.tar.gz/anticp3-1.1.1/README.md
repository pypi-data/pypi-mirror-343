# ANTICP3 â€” Anticancer Protein Prediction

**ANTICP3** is a LLM-based tool for binary classification of proteins into *Anticancer* or *Non-Anticancer* classes, based solely on their primary amino acid sequences. It leverages the powerful [ESM2-t33](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D) transformer model, fine-tuned specifically for anticancer protein prediction.
