class Url(ABC):
    '''A class which represents a URL.

    A URL in 3LC is a combination of a scheme and a path. Many methods in 3LC accept URLs as arguments and/or return
    URLs. They are also used to refer to [Tables](tlc.core.objects.table.Table) and to cross reference between them. A
    file URL in 3LC will behave identically on both Posix and Windows systems.

    Since a URL in 3LC might contain aliases, and even the scheme might not be determined until aliases are expanded, it
    is important to note which methods and properties will expand.

    The [path](tlc.core.url.Url.path) and [scheme](#tlc.core.url.Url.scheme) properties of the URL will expand aliases

    :Examples:

    *Scheme is determined from the input string*

    ```python
    file_url = Url("/path/to/file")  # Or Url("file:///path/to/file")
    file_url.scheme == Scheme.FILE
    file_url.path == "/path/to/file"
    str(file_url) == "/path/to/file"  # omit file:// scheme

    s3_url = Url("s3://bucket/path/to/object")
    s3_url.scheme == Scheme.S3
    s3_url.path == "bucket/path/to/object"

    gcs_url = Url("gs://bucket/path/to/object")
    gcs_url.scheme == Scheme.GS
    gcs_url.path == "bucket/path/to/object"
    str(gcs_url) == "gs://bucket/path/to/object"  # include gs:// scheme

    relative_url = Url("path/to/file")
    relative_url.scheme == Scheme.RELATIVE
    relative_url.path == "path/to/file"
    str(relative_url) == "path/to/file"  # omit relative:// scheme

    # *Aliases are expanded when the URL is used*
    # Assume <SAMPLE_DATA> is **not** registered
    alias_url = Url("<SAMPLE_DATA>/data.csv")
    alias_url.scheme == Scheme.ALIAS
    alias_url.path == "<SAMPLE_DATA>/data.csv"
    str(alias_url) == "<SAMPLE_DATA>/data.csv"

    # Set the alias
    UrlAliasRegistry.instance().register_url_alias(token="<SAMPLE_DATA>", path="/path/to/data")
    # It will now be expanded when using path and scheme properties
    alias_url.scheme == Scheme.FILE

    :Terminology:

    - A _normalized_ URL has a scheme, uses single-forward slashes as path separator, and does not end-with a slash.
    - An _expanded_ URL has aliases expanded, and is normalized.
    - An _absolute_ URL is a expanded which means that it can be used as a stable persisted reference.
       - Relative URLs are converted to absolute URLs based on an "owner" URL, or, if applicable, the current working
         directory of the process
    - Relative and Api URLs will have "relative://" or "api://" as their scheme but these schemes will be omitted
      from the stringified representation.

    :Caveats:
    - The URL does not make any network calls or access to the file system. It therefore cannot resolve symlinks, and
      use of these is discouraged in combination with 3LC.
    - There are a few exotic Windows paths that are not supported:
      - The use of a Windows-drive letter without a slash, e.g. `C:foo/bar`, is not supported. Use `C:/foo/bar` instead.

    :param value: The URL as a string, Path, or Url object. When this argument is passed as a string, it will be
                  normalized and the scheme is deduced from the string contents.
    :param scheme: The scheme of the URL, if known.
    :param normalized_path: The normalized path of the URL, if known. If both scheme and normalized_path are passed,
                            they will be used directly without any normalization or parsing. It is the responsibility of
                            the caller to ensure that the scheme and normalized_path are valid.
