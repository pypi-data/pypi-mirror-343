    ch = logging.StreamHandler()
    ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(\'%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')

    This will cause all tqdm progress bar updates to be logged by your logger. However, the filter will prevent them
    from actually being output if they contain the "interactive": True attribute in their extra dict.

    This filter can be used to prevent tqdm progress bars from being logged, e.g. when running in a non-interactive
    environment like pytest.

    The filter can also be configured to use a specific field from the log record as the duplicate key. In this case,
    the filter will use the value of the field to determine if a log message is a duplicate and not consider the message
    text and location. This version is more memory efficient.

    When the number of unique messages exceeds `max_tracked_messages`, it clears the stored counts to manage memory
    usage.
