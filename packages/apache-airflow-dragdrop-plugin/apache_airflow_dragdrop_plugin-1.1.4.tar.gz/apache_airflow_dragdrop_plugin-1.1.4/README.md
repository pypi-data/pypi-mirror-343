![alt text](image-1.png)


&#x20;&#x20;

The **Apache Airflow Drag-and-Drop Plugin** enhances the Apache Airflow UI by allowing users to create and manage workflows using a **drag-and-drop interface**. 

This plugin simplifies the process of creating DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) by providing an intuitive visual interface. 🎉

### Features ✨

✅ **Drag-and-Drop Interface** – Easily create and modify DAGs visually. 

✅ **Predefined Templates** – Use templates for common workflows.

✅ **Custom Operators** – Extend the palette with custom operators.

✅ **Real-Time Validation** – Validate workflows before deployment. 

✅ **Export DAG Code** – Save workflows as .py file.
