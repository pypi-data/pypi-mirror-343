# APIRotater

A simple Python library that automatically manages and rotates multiple API keys to prevent rate limit issues.

## What It Does

- **Automatically rotates between multiple API keys** so you don't hit rate limits
- **Tracks usage** of each API key
- **Manages rate limits** by specifying max uses in a time window
- **Loads API keys from .env files** in current directory, parent directory, or executable location
- **Works with Windows EXE applications** when packaged

## Installation

```bash
pip install apirotater
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a .env file with your API keys

```
API_KEY_1=your_first_api_key
API_KEY_2=your_second_api_key
API_KEY_3=your_third_api_key
```

### 2. Use in your code

```python
import apirotater

# Get an API key
api_key = apirotater.key()

# Use the API key for your request
response = make_your_api_request(api_key)

# IMPORTANT: Always report when you've used a key
apirotater.hit(api_key)
```

## Basic Example

```python
import apirotater
import time

# Simple usage loop
for _ in range(10):
    # Get a new API key (rotates automatically)
    api_key = apirotater.key()
    
    # Use the key for your API request
    print(f"Making request with key: {api_key}")
    
    # IMPORTANT: Report that you used the key
    apirotater.hit(api_key)
    
    # Wait before next request
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Rate Limiting

```python
import apirotater

# Get a key with maximum 5 uses in 60 seconds
api_key = apirotater.key(time_window=60, max_uses=5)

# Use the key
print(f"Using key: {api_key}")

# Report usage
apirotater.hit(api_key)
```

## Custom .env File Location

For Windows EXE applications or custom setups, you can specify the .env file location:

```python
import apirotater
import os
import sys

# For regular applications - use current directory
env_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), ".env")

# For Windows EXE applications - use executable directory
# env_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(sys.argv[0]))

# Load API keys from specific location
apirotater.load_env_file(env_path)

# Then use normally
api_key = apirotater.key()
```

## API Reference

- `key(time_window=60, max_uses=100)` - Get an API key
- `hit(api_key)` - Report that you've used an API key (ALWAYS call this)
- `load_env_file(path)` - Load API keys from a specific .env file
- `usage()` - Get usage statistics for all keys
- `get_all_keys()` - Get a list of all loaded API keys
- `get_current_key_name()` - Get the name of the current API key

## Error Handling

```python
import apirotater
import time

try:
    api_key = apirotater.key()
    # Use the key...
    apirotater.hit(api_key)
except apirotater.RateLimitExceeded:
    # All keys exceeded rate limits
    print("All API keys reached rate limit")
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait and try again
```
