# ProblemSolvr ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **ProblemSolvr** â€” a simple, fun, and powerful Python library to solve problems using classic AI search algorithms.

---

## âœ¨ What is this?

ProblemSolvr is a library that me and my buddy built together â€” with full josh, night coding sessions, aur dimaag ki dahi banake ðŸ˜….  
We wanted to make solving problems (like graph search, maze solving, puzzles) **super easy** for everyone.  
No boring long codes, no stress â€” just simple function calls, aur kaam ho gaya!

## ðŸ§  What can you do with it?

- Solve problems using:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A* Search (with heuristic)
  - Greedy Best-First Search (with heuristic)
- Visualize the solution path on the graph
- See how many steps it took and how fast it solved
- Compare different algorithms easily

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

(After it's uploaded on PyPi)

```bash
pip install problemsolvr
