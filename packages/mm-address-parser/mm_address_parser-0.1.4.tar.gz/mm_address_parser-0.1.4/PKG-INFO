# Project Title
**Myanmar Address Parsing**

## Project Description

This project parses the given address into different components (state, district, township, ward, village) to search in the Mimu database. The address will be parsed to identify the hierarchical address levels, starting with the highest level (state) and moving down to the lowest level (village or ward). This ensures that the address is accurately parsed even if certain components are ambiguous or missing.

### Tasks

1. **Extracting hierarchical components** from the address input, such as state, district, township, ward, and village.
2. **Handling different types of address formats** including those with missing or incomplete components.
3. **Parsing address in multiple languages** (Myanmar and English), ensuring compatibility with both.
4. **Standardizing parsed data** to be consistent with the Mimu database structure, facilitating easier search and geolocation retrieval.
