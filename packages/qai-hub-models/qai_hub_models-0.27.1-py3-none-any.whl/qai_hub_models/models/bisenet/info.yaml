description: BiSeNet (Bilateral Segmentation Network) is a novel architecture designed
  for real-time semantic segmentation. It addresses the challenge of balancing spatial
  resolution and receptive field by employing a Spatial Path to preserve high-resolution
  features and a context path to capture sufficient receptive field.
