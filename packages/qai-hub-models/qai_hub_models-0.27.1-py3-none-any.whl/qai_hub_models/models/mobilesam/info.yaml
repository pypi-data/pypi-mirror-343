headline: "FASTER SEGMENT ANYTHING: TOWARDS LIGHTWEIGHT SAM
FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS."
domain: Computer Vision
use_case: Semantic Segmentation
description: Transformer based encoder-decoder where prompts specify what to segment
  in an image thereby allowing segmentation without the need for additional training.
  The image encoder generates embeddings and the lightweight decoder operates on the
  embeddings for point and mask based image segmentation.
