The basis of the movement model system in epymorph.
Movement models are responsible for dividing up the day
into one or more parts, in accordance with their desired
tempo of movement. (For example, commuting patterns of work day
versus night.) Movement mechanics are expressed using a set of
clauses which calculate a requested number of individuals move
between geospatial nodes at a particular time step of the simulation.
