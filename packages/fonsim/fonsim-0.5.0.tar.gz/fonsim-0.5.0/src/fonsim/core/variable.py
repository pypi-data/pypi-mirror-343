class Variable:
    """
    A ``Variable`` object is used to denote the presence of a yet unknown numerical value.
    For each Variable object, the solver will search for the optimal numerical values over time.
    The solver does so by solving the system of equations that connect these variables together.
    The variables are connected by each other
    by connecting the Terminal objects that contain the values to each other.

    The parameter 'key' indicates the type label.
    Only Variable objects with the same type label can exchange information.

    The parameter 'orientation' should have value 'across' or 'through' or 'free'.
    'across' indicates that the value of the Variable will be shared
    with the Variable belonging to the other Terminal
    while 'through' indicates that its negative will be shared.
    The former is typically used with nondirectional values,
    such as pressure,
    while the latter is typically used with directional values,
    such as a massflow.
    'local' indicates that it will not be shared (feature WIP).
