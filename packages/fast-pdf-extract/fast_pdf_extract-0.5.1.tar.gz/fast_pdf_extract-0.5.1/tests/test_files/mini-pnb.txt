**ANNUAL
REPORT**

**lef"V vkfFkZd ifj–';**

The year 2024 is a momentous year for Punjab National Bank as it 
enters its 130th year of operations from its commencement on 12th 
April, 1895, from Lahore. The bank has travelled a long way, gaining 
strength and braving strong winds of change, indicating its tenacity 
over the past so many years. Built on the principles of prudence, 
caution, and a forward-looking approach, PNB has come out stronger, 
weathering many crises, and has grown to be the repository of trust 
among its stakeholders and customers.  

Punjab National Bank, in its journey over the last 13 decades, has 
played a highly instrumental role in shaping the banking landscape of 
pre and post-independence India, and continues to play a significant 
role in the country’s economic growth. 

It gives me great pleasure to share with you the progress your Bank 
has made and the general operating environment in FY2023-24.

**Macro-Economic Scenario**

The global economy in FY2023-24 fared better than expected, 
marked by fading fears of recession and a resurgence in growth in 
major economies. Despite economic growth in manufacturing and 
services, global headwinds due to wars persisted. The Russia-Ukraine 
conflict extended and a new Israel-Palestine war partially disrupted 
trade routes. 

Amidst these global trends, the Indian economy remained resilient 
and was the fastest-growing major economy in the world. As per the 
BCG report1, the Indian Economy is at an inflection point today and 
will become a developed nation by 2047. “Today, India is becoming 
the engine of global growth with 15 percent share in global GDP 
growth”2. The economic growth of India exceeded expectations and 
surprised the upside with growth greater than 8.0 per cent in three-
quarters of FY2023-24. It is at a strong 8.2 per cent for the whole year. 
The year ended on a positive note, with high-frequency indicators 
like GST collections, car sales, and UPI transactions hitting high 
spots. India’s Manufacturing PMI climbed to a 16-year high of 59.1 
in March’2024.

**Chairman’s Message**

1   BCG presentation-Emerging Trends and Implications for PNB dated 6th April 2024
2   Excerpts from Prime Minister’s address RBI@90 opening ceremony dated 1st April, 

2024, in Mumbai

As per the BCG report, the key drivers that are propelling India’s 
growth story are large domestic consumption demand on the back 
of rising disposable income, global realignment of supply chains; 
government launched Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme 
to boost manufacturing, high export potential turning India into a 
factory of the world, supportive financial ecosystem with rising public 
capex and demographic dividend.  

India’s digital landscape presents exciting prospects. The burgeoning 
e-commerce, fintech, and Artificial Intelligence sectors offer a 
multitude of avenues for qualified professionals. Government 
programs like Digital India are fostering digital inclusion, expanding 
internet access and propelling the digital economy forward. However, 
there is a need for robust cybersecurity measures which ensure the 
integrity of digital processes and provide a shield against evolving 
threats, making it a cornerstone of successful digital transformation.

Climate change poses significant risks to both the global and Indian 
economies. Globally, rising temperatures could reduce GDP by up to 
18% by 2050, according to a report by Swiss Re Institute3. Economies 
around the world will need to take collective action to mitigate climate 
risk. India is at the forefront of mitigating climate change. India 
has shown active participation in global climate change initiatives 
and commitment to renewable energy. India has initiated forums 
for climate action, such as the International Solar Alliance, LeadIT, 
Climate and Disaster Resilience Initiative, Infrastructure for Resilient 
Island States, Green Credit Initiative and International Big Cat Alliance. 
The Reserve bank of India on its part has also framed the Green 
Deposit framework for banks and issued guidelines for disclosure 
of climate related risks by its regulated entities. SEBI has similarly 
issued disclosure guidelines called the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) which mandate listed companies to 
make disclosures related to sustainability parameters. India has also 
achieved in 2020-21 the renewable energy target it had set for 2030. 
India aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 and fulfil 50 per cent 
of its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030.

**Banking Scenario**

The last financial year marked a significant milestone for Indian 
banks, representing the best performance in a decade. Across all 
fundamental pillars—business growth, asset quality, profitability and 
capital adequacy —positive growth was evident. Bank credit surged to 
decadal-high levels, reaching 16 per cent (and 20 per cent considering 
the merger impact of HDFC Bank with HDFC Ltd.), primarily driven by 
robust demand for retail loans, as per RBI’s fortnightly data4. Notably, 
gross NPAs decreased from 11.25 per cent in 2018 to below 3 per 
cent by September 2023.

Public Sector Banks played a pivotal role, with cumulative profits 
exceeding Rs. 1.4 Lakh Crore—a remarkable 35 per cent growth over 

**cSafdax ifj–';**

**ANNUAL
REPORT**

the previous year. This transformation owes much to government 
initiatives and reforms. However, decline in market share of business 
remained a challenge for all the Public Sector Banks.

Simultaneously, the Indian banking landscape underwent a structural 
shift. Banks embraced innovation and digitalization, introducing 
various digital products and services. UPI transactions crossed the 
100 billion mark in FY' 2023-24, registering a remarkable 56 per 
cent yearly growth. India now leads globally, accounting for 46 per 
cent of all digital payments. Lending to value chains, too, has made 
significant progress in digitization. This transition towards digital 
banking reflects India’s journey towards a less cash economy. 

The adoption of digital banking capabilities, along with Government 
initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Unified 
Payment Interface (UPI) and Goods and Service Tax (GST), has brought 
over 50 crore individuals and numerous small businesses into the 
formal banking system. Further initiatives by the Government and 
the regulator like harnessing Goods and Services Tax (GST) invoices 
on IndiaStack, the 59-minute Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise 
(MSME) loan portal, introduction of more players in the financial 
ecosystem such as Account Aggregator and Payment Aggregators, 
digitalization of KCC loans, expanding the scope and coverage of UPI 
and greater interoperability of UPI with other IT applications. Central 
Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Open Network for Digital Commerce 
(ONDC) etc. will further mature the financial ecosystem. 

Banks will continue to deploy emerging technologies like artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to 
improve operational efficiency, mitigate risks, enhance customer 
experience, and develop innovative services. Banks are also 
experimenting with supply chain financing that will enable smoother 
transactions, reduce risks and enhance overall efficiency. 

Apart from extending credit to traditional sectors of the economy like 
MSME and Agriculture, banks are also expected to venture into new 
emerging sectors like Space, Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy, etc.

Banks in India are gearing up for the next wave of technology-
fuelled innovations in services with the imminent growth of 5G 
internet usage, deeper smartphone penetration, expansion of digital 
payments, frictionless data-led digital lending, risk-mitigated secure 
data protection and collaboration between banks and FinTechs. The 
banking sector will aid the consumption and investment growth 
in the economy by providing credit for the needy sectors of the 
economy. The above steps will pave the way for India to become the 
third-largest economy with a GDP of $5 trillion by 2027. 

**Developments at your Bank**

Beginning its journey from a pure Swadeshi capital of Rs.20,000 on 
12th April 1895, the Bank achieved the landmark of Rs.23 lakh crore 
in Gross Business as of 31st March 2024. In FY’2023-24, your Bank 
registered the highest net profit year-on-year growth at 228 per cent 
to Rs.8,245 crores among all the Public Sector Banks. The Bank has 

**vkids cSad esa fodkl**

made significant progress in asset quality in the last two years, and 
now its Net NPA and Provisioning Coverage Ratio are in line with the 
industry. The Bank is also well capitalized with a capital adequacy 
ratio of 15.97 per cent as of March’2024 as against the regulatory 
requirement of 11.5 per cent. 

On the back of strong financial performance and gaining investors’ 
trust, the PNB’s market capitalization crossed Rs.1 lakh crore mark 
on 15th December 2023. Our Bank is the third PSB to achieve this 
feat, and it has also joined the top 50 most valuable listed stocks 
in terms of market capitalization.

Your Bank has always been striving to offer the best. Customer delight 
at all levels and in all transactions is our goal. To achieve this, PNB 
embarked on a Digital Transformation Journey and in the last 2 years 
has launched more than 100 digital products, processes and portals. 
The three pillars on which this digital transformation journey was 
based are –revamping of channels to make them more efficient, 
reduce human intervention and building the best capabilities. 

Keeping customer centricity in mind, Bank offers a range of Current 
Account and Savings Account products to cater to varied financial 
needs of different customer segments. Your Bank has introduced 
various new features and services in its mobile and internet 
banking application to facilitate ease of banking services and also 
strengthened its customer grievance redress mechanism. We are 
constantly collaborating with the Fintech ecosystem to pave the way 
for a more inclusive financial service landscape, with the primary goal 
of enhancing customer service. 

Your Bank is also incorporating Artificial Intelligence, Machine 
Learning in various processes like risk mitigation, model development, 
optimizing cash retention in ATM & BNA5 machines, transaction 
based nudges for boosting retail products, lead generation, customer 
retention, etc. 

Your Bank undertook various measures last year to reinforce 
sharper risk management at the bank like setting up of a climate risk 
management cell, dedicated Market Intelligence Unit, introducing 
new Early Warning System SAJAG 2.0 for effective credit monitoring, 
risk dashboard, strengthening of product approval process etc. 

Your Bank also undertook various steps to strengthen its compliance 
culture like Compliance Monitoring Tool to track and monitor 
individual level compliance, Penalty Reporting and Monitoring 
System to track regulatory penalties and monitoring Compliance Risk 
at Bank level using in-house developed Compliance Risk Assessment 
Model.

India strives to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, and your Bank will 
play a pivotal role in this transition. PNB has launched various schemes 
for green financing like financing of Electric Vehicles, rooftop solar 
panels and extending credit to various renewable energy projects.

**ANNUAL
REPORT**

The Bank last year also launched PNB Palaash, an eight-month period 
campaign to embrace sustainability in bank’s operations through 
measures such as energy and resource conservation, paper reduction, 
waste management and streamlined digital processes.

**Going Forward**

For accelerating business growth, Your Bank will continue to focus 
on all the segments like Retail, Agriculture, MSME and Corporates. 
For Retail Credit, Bank has multiple products for meeting the credit 
needs of the customers at competitive rates and it is leveraging its 
specialized loan processing points and marketing verticals. Bank will 
undertake tie-ups with Builders, Home Loan Counsellors, Car Dealers 
and NBFCs for driving retail credit growth on continued basis. 

Your Bank will continue its focus on agriculture portfolio to help 
farmers meet their credit requirements. Apart from leveraging its 
dense network of rural branches, Your Bank will continue to market 
its digital products for agriculture i.e. Agri Gold Loan, Krishi Tatkal Rin 
etc. Bank also plans to tie up with State Rural Livelihood Mission for 
financing of Self Help Groups and for financing food and agriculture 
based ancillary activities. 

Improved credit culture due to focused processing centres made the 
Bank well positioned to capitalize an increase in MSME loans with 
the upswing in GDP. 13.5 Lakh vendors are registered on Government 
e-Marketplace (GeM) providing a large opportunity to increase 
MSME portfolio. In India, the number of MSMEs are expected to 
grow from 6.3 Crore to 7.2 Crore in the coming years. Only 15% 
of MSMEs are under the purview of formal credit, providing vast 
untapped potential, that could be exploited by your bank through 
vast network of branches, specialized centres for MSME loans, array 
of schemes and products for MSME segment and digital channels. 
Apart from the existing 58 MSME clusters, the Bank aims to identify 
additional clusters. For each cluster, we plan to introduce customized 
financial products and an awareness program, all facilitated through 
cluster-based financing at competitive interest rates.

For Corporate Credit, Bank has dedicated Extra Large Corporate 
Branches/ Large Corporate Branches and Centralized Industry Oriented 
Credit Desk at Head Office for quick disposal of credit proposals. Your 
Bank will continue to extend credit in Core Industries like Infrastructure 
sectors, Real Estate, Engineering Procurement and Construction, Food 
Processing along with 14 sectors for which government has launched 
the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.

All these measures are  expected to help the Bank regain its market 
share in overall business.

Bank is ensuring to align its business growth strategy with its risk 
appetite. Your Bank has devised various policies and frameworks for 
management of risk emanating from various sources like economic 
uncertainties, climate risks, regulatory risks, cyber risks etc.

Your Bank strongly believes in giving back to the society which 
are evident from its various initiatives, CSR activities and training 
programs. Bank has 12 Farmer Training Centres (FTCs) across the 
country that are aiding farmers by providing them training on 
agriculture & allied activities, maintenance of tractor and other farm 
machineries, processing and preservation of fruits and vegetables, 
computer courses, running of beauty parlour, tailoring & embroidery, 
etc. Since inception, FTCs has provided training to more than 18 lakh 
farmers, youth including young girls and women from rural areas. 
Your Bank also provided free financial literacy and credit counselling 
in FY’2023-24 to around 3 lakh people, including different groups like 
Farmers, Self Help Groups, Micro and Small Entrepreneurs, Senior 
Citizens etc. through its 175 Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs). These 
programs aided these groups to have better financial planning that 
helps them inculcate the habit of financial prudence. Bank is also 
providing training to the rural population for skill up-gradation to 
undertake self-employment ventures and jobs and has helped 
around 6 lakh persons to settle through its 76 Rural Self Employment 
Training Institutes (RSETIs) and 2 Rural Development Centres (RDCs) 
since inception. Our RSETIs focus on settlement of participants by 
also ensuring adequate credit for inclusive growth.

Your Bank continues to discharge its social obligations with 
enthusiasm, which includes free medical camps, blood donation 
camps, besides frequent donations and infrastructure support to 
Hospitals, Schools, Defence Stations etc. The Bank also supports 
various societies, charitable institutions and NGOs working for the 
benefit of weaker sections of society. 

Going forward, PNB will play an active role in the vision of Viksit 
Bharat by extending credit support to all sectors of the economy with 
special focus on MSME, Agriculture, Women and Youth. 

Your Bank will continue to deploy generative Artificial Intelligence 
and predictive analytics in its operations for cross-selling and 
upselling opportunities. Your Bank will continue to facilitate ease 
of banking through Mobile First experience, Anywhere Banking, 
Whatsapp Banking, Chatbots, and intuitive mobile apps that will 
help in broadening the financial reach and enhancing the customer 
experience and trust. It is also committed to make the digital 
experience as safe as possible for its various stakeholders by investing 
in appropriate technology to make its systems robust and reliable.

PNB will continue to reassess its processes, user interface and 
banking experience to optimize efficiencies, minimize expenses, 
strengthen customer relationships and enhance regulatory 
compliance and governance to eventually become one of the most 
competitive Banks in the industry.

The Bank believes that human resources are its strongest asset and 
thus continues to focus on upskilling and grooming of its employees 
through its ambitious project UDAAN. Bank in the last financial year 
introduced various tools and initiatives to enhance productivity of its 
employees and effectively utilize its human resources.

The Bank will continue to serve the nation with the same zeal and 
vigour as it has done for the past 13 decades. It will continue to make

**Dear valued stakeholders**

On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Management Team, I 
am pleased to share Annual Report of the Bank for FY 2023-24. This 
report shares our unwavering commitment to responsible growth, 
as well as the significant milestones and achievements the Bank has 
accomplished in the previous financial year.

**Global Economy**

On the global front, the economy remained remarkably resilient, with 
steady growth and a declining inflation. The stable growth in economic 
activities defied warnings of stagflation and global recession. As per 
the World Economic Outlook Report April 2024 of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), Global growth, estimated at 3.2 per cent in the 
Calendar Year (CY) 2023, is projected to continue at the same pace 
in Calendar Years 2024 and 2025. During CY 2023, global inflation 
descended from its mid-2022 peak as a result of central banks raising 
policy rates around the world. However, as inflation is converging 
towards target levels, central banks are pivoting towards policy 
easing.

**Indian Economy**

India’s economy showed strength amid global challenges and 
geopolitical issues driven by strong domestic demand, especially rural 
demand, robust investments, and steady manufacturing growth. Real 
GDP increased by 8.2 per cent in FY 2023-24, with strong investment 
activity. It is higher than the growth of 7.0 per cent in the previous 
year. The buoyant domestic economic landscape is further evidenced 
by improvements in consumer and investor confidence, reflected 
in enhanced sentiment across various sectors. Capital inflows in 
India saw a significant turnaround in FY2023-24 and India’s foreign 
exchange reserves reached an all-time high in March 2024 i.e. $645.6 
billion.

During FY 2023-24, headline CPI inflation averaged at 5.3%, vs. 
the target of 4% (±2%). Despite a declining trajectory of inflation, 
sporadic food price shocks introduced significant volatility. Core 
inflation (which excludes food and fuel) followed a downward path, 
reaching 3.5% in March 2024. In light of this diminishing trajectory,

the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained an unchanged 
policy repo rate of 6.50% throughout FY 2023-24, aiming to strike a 
balance between economic growth and inflation control.

**Banking Industry**

FY 2023-24 has been an exceptionally good year for the entire 
banking industry particularly in terms of Business growth, Asset 
Quality, Profitability and Capital Adequacy. Public sector banks in 
India have posted a stellar performance, with profits crossing Rs.1.4 
trillion for FY 2023-24 vis-à-vis Rs.1.1 trillion in FY 2022-23. PSBs’ 
market performance was reflected in soaring Market Capitalisation 
and stock return also improved during the year.

The asset quality of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) exhibited positive 
trends during FY 2023-24. Both gross non-performing assets (GNPA) 
and net non-performing assets (NNPA) declined to their lowest 
levels in a decade. Additionally, the Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 
Ratio (CRAR) remained comfortably above the regulatory limit. This 
achievement can be attributed to the concerted efforts focused on 
enhancing asset quality, embracing digitalization and implementing 
strategic reforms at various levels.

**Developments in your Bank**

Throughout the year, the Bank continued to support the economic 
revival by way of extending credit to all the sectors while ensuring 
regulatory compliances and adhering to corporate governance 
norms.

Now I would like to place your Bank’s financial and operational 
performance during FY 2023-24.

**Sustaining the growth momentum in Business**

As on 31st March 2024, the Bank’s Global Business grew to 
Rs. 23,53,038 Crore with Gross Global Advances at Rs.9,83,325 Crore 
and Global Deposit at Rs.13,69,713 Crore. The Bank has continued to 
focus on CASA deposits with current Deposit at Rs.72,201 Crore and 
Saving Deposits at Rs.4,80,298 Crore as on 31st March, 2024. Overall 
CASA Deposits as on 31st March, 2024 stood at Rs.5,52,499 Crore as 
against Rs. 5,38,015 Crore as on 31st March, 2023. CASA Share was at 
41.44 per cent as on 31st March, 2024.

**Consistency in Profit and improving ratios**

FY 2023-24 saw a consistent rise in profitability parameters. Bank’s 
Operating Profit was at Rs. 24,931 Crore in FY 2023-24 vis-à-vis 
Rs. 22,529 Crore in FY 2022-23 registering the growth of 10.7 per cent 
with the help of strong growth of 16.2 per cent year on year basis in 
Net Interest Income. Net Profit grew by more than 225 per cent to 
Rs.8245 Crore in FY 2023-24 on account of improving asset quality.

During FY 2023-24, Return on Assets and Return on Equity improved 
to 0.54 per cent (0.18 per cent in FY 2022-23) and 11.66 per cent (3.94 
per cent in FY 2022-23) respectively. The key productivity parameters, 
Business per employee and Business per branch increased to Rs.2384 
Lakh and Rs. 22,525 Lakh respectively as on 31st March 2024 from 

**ANNUAL

**fjVsy] —f"k vkSj ,e,l,ebZ ¼jSe½ ij Qksdl**

Rs. 2164 Lakh and Rs. 20, 953 Lakh respectively as on 31st March 
2023. The domestic and global Net Interest Margin (NIM) was robust 
at 3.23 per cent and 3.09 per cent respectively in FY 2023-24.

**Focus on RAM**

The Bank continued to give due importance to high yielding Retail, 
Agriculture and MSME (RAM) segment to improve its lending growth 
and diversify its portfolio. RAM Advances as on 31st March, 2024 
stood at Rs. 5,20,050 Crore showing year on year growth of 10.7 per 
cent with RAM share to Domestic Advances at 55.2 per cent.

Under RAM, Retail Segment showed a growth of 12.6 per cent and 
stood at Rs.2,22,574 Crore as on 31st March 2024.

Agriculture segment also showed a growth of 11.3 per cent 
and stood at Rs.1,58,188 Crore while MSME segment showed 
the growth of 7.0 per cent and was Rs.1,39,288 Crore as on 31st 
March 2024. During FY 2023-24, MSME customers who graduated 
beyond MSME and were reclassified as mid corporate customers. 
Accordingly, if the impact of reclassification is taken into account in 
the base figures as on 31st March, 2023, then MSME growth would 
be 12.0% year on year basis.

**Asset Quality Improvement-Performing better than before**

The Bank maintained its focus on enhancing asset quality and these 
efforts were reflected by way of reduction in Gross and Net NPA 
numbers sequentially. Gross NPA reduced to Rs. 56,343 Crore as on 
31st March, 2024 from the level of Rs.77,328 Crore as on 31st March, 
2023 showing a decline of 16.4 per cent on YoY. Net NPA declined to 
Rs 6,799 Crore as on 31st March, 2024 from the level of Rs. 22,585 
Crore as on 31st March, 2023 registering a year on year decline of 
69.9 per cent.

Gross NPA ratio improved by 301 bps to 5.73 per cent, Net NPA ratio 
came below 1 per cent as on 31st March 2024 and was at 0.73 per 
cent hence showing a reduction by 199 bps over 31st March 2023. 
Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) (incl. TWO) moved upto 95.4 per 
cent as on 31st March 2024 from 86.9 per cent as on 31st March 2023 
showing an improvement of 850 bps.

The Bank’s position in Asset Quality improved mainly on the back of
