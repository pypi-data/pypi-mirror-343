**Overview**
-----------

OSFM-Net is a part of the OSFM system, which enables remote file management and access. This documentation will guide developers through the functionality and usage of the script.

**High-Level Explanation**
-------------------------

The script can run in two modes: server and client. 

*   When run as a server, it initializes the OSFM server and ensures the temporary folder is shared.
*   When run as a client, it enables remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections and starts the main client application.


**Server Mode**
----------------

When the script is run with the `--server` command-line argument, it checks if an existing server instance is already running. If not, it ensures the temporary folder is shared and starts the server.

**Client Mode**
----------------

When the script is run without the `--server` argument, it enables RDP connections and starts the main client application.

**Logging**
-----------

All output from the script is logged to a file named `osfm-net.log`. This includes any error messages or debugging information.
