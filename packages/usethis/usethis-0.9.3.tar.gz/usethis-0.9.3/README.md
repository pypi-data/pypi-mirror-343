Automate Python project setup and development tasks that are otherwise performed manually.

`usethis` knows about popular Python tools, workflows and frameworks, and knows how they interact. It can declaratively add and remove tools, configure them, and set up the project for you in a way that won't break your existing configuration and it will make the necessary adjustments to your project configuration files.

`usethis` gives detailed messages about what it is doing (and what you need to do next).

- Output beginning with `‚úî` represents a task which usethis has automated.
- Output beginning with `‚òê` represents a task which you need to perform manually.
- Output beginning with `‚Ñπ` gives hints and tips.

Inspired by an [**R** package of the same name](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html), this package brings a similar experience to the Python ecosystem as a CLI tool.

## Highlights

- üß∞ First-class support for state-of-the-practice tooling: `uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `pre-commit`, and many more.
- ü§ñ Automatically add and remove tools: declare, install, and configure in one step.
- üß† Powerful knowledge of how different tools interact and sensible defaults.
- üì¢ Fully declarative project configuration.
- ‚ö° Get started on a new Python project or a new workflow in seconds.

## üß≠ Getting Started

First, it is strongly recommended you [install the `uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): this is a simple, documented process. If you're already using `uv`, make sure you're using at least
version v0.5.29 (run `uv version` to check, and `uv self update` to upgrade).

> [!TIP]
> At the moment, `usethis` assumes you will have `uv` installed in some circumstances. Support for projects that don't use `uv` is planned for late 2025.

Then, you can install usethis for the project:

```console
# With uv
$ uv add --dev usethis

# With pip
$ pip install usethis
```

Alternatively, run in isolation, using `uvx` or `pipx`.

## üìö Similar Projects

Not sure if usethis is the exact fit for your project?

The closest match to usethis is [PyScaffold](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold/). It provides a Command Line Interface to automate the creation of a project from a sensible templated structure.

You could also consider your own hard-coded template. Templating tools such as [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) and [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) allow you to create static templates with fixed configuration you can use across multiple projects. However, it's not always obvious which template you should use, and many do not use state-of-practice tooling such as `pyproject.toml`. Also, sometimes a template can overwhelm you with too many unfamiliar tools.

You could [consider this template](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-uv) which works with Copier, or [this template](https://github.com/johnthagen/python-blueprint) which works with Cookiecutter.

> [!TIP]
> You can still use usethis as a part of a templates using [hooks](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/hooks.html#using-pre-post-generate-hooks-0-7-0) for Cookiecutter and [tasks](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#tasks) for Copier.

One of usethis's strengths is that it can update existing configuration. If you're using Cookiecutter, then you can update to a latest version of a template using a tool like [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft). Copier has inbuilt support for template updating.
