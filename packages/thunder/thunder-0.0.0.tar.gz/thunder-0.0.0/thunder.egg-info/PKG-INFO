> _You saw the lightning. Now it's time to hear the thunder_ üå©Ô∏è

# Thunder üå©Ô∏è 

The Deep Learning framework based on [Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning).

## Install

```bash
pip install thunder
```

:warning:  
> Currently thunder is not published on pypi. Install it via git clone.  

## Start experimenting

It's as simple as 1, 2, 3:

1. Create a config (e.g. `base.config`):
    ```python
    from myproject import MyDataset, MyModule
    from lightning import Trainer
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
    
    # these 3 fields are required
    train_data = DataLoader(MyDataset())
    module = MyModule()
    trainer = Trainer()
    ```

2. Build the experiment:
   ```shell
   thunder build base.config /path/to/some/folder
   ```

3. Run it
    ```shell
    thunder run /path/to/some/folder
    ```

Also, 2 and 3 can be combined into a single command:
```shell
thunder build-run base.config /path/to/some/folder
```

## More advanced stuff
