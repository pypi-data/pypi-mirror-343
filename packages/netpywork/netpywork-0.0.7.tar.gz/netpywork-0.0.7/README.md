**netpywork** is a library that makes using tcp and udp server and client easier

# Features
- Creating a server and client which uses `TCP` and `UDP`
- Callbacks for `On Receive`, `On Connect` and `On Disconnect` for server
- Callbacks for `On Receive` and `On Connect` for client
- Sending messages from server to client both with tcp and udp by specifing the address to send to (see examples [here](https://github.com/MurkyYT/netpywork/tree/main))
