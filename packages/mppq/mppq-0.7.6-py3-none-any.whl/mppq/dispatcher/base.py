    For the most part, all operations within graph can be partitioned into quantable
    operations, Shape-Or-Index (SOI) related operations and remaining operations, all
    sub classes of GraphDispatcher will give an implementation of function "dispatch"
    to send all operations to their proper platform.

    ATTENTION:

        platform attribute will greatly affect quantizer's quantization logic, and the
        execution result.
        If operation is sent to a quantable platform, then its inputs and outputs will
        be quantized if necessary.
        if operation is classified as shape-or-index related operation, then its
        execution will be taken with cpu.
        if operation is sent to a fp32 platform, then its inputs and outputs shall
        never be quantized.
