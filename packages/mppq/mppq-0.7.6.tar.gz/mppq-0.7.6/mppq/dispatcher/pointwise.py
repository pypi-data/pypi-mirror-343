    r"""Graph Dispatcher cuts a graph into parts, each part of graph will
    dispatch to a specific platform for further execution and quantization.

    For the most part, all operations within graph can be partitioned into quantable
    operations, Shape-Or-Index related operations and remaining operations, all sub
    classes of GraphDispatcher will give an implementation of function "dispatch" to
    send all operations to their proper platform.

    Point Dispatch send all computing op to quantable platform, while other ops remain
    unchanged.

    ATTENTION:

        platform attribute will greatly affect quantizer's quantization logic, and the
        execution result.

        - If operation is sent to a quantable platform, then its inputs and outputs
          will be quantized if necessary.
        - If operation is classified as shape-or-index related operation, then its
          execution will be taken with cpu.
        - If operation is sent to a fp32 platform, then its inputs and outputs shall
          never be quantized.

    ATTENTION:

        this dispatcher will insert necessary DeviceSwitch operations between
        shape-or-index operations and others.
