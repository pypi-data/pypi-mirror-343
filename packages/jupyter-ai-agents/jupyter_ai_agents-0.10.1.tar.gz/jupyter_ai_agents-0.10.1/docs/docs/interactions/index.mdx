# Interaction Modes

The **interaction modes** refer to how the agent is used.

- [`Ask Mode`](/docs/interactions/ask-mode) - The Agent is explicitely `requested` by the User.
- [`Listen Mode`](/docs/interactions/listen-mode) - The Agent `observes` the Notebook an Kernels events and is requested when a specific event occurs without User action.

To interact with the Agent, you will need to.

- Provide information via [`Inputters`](/docs/interactions/inputters)
- Retrieve the result via [`Outputters`](/docs/interactions/outputters).

[`Controllers`](/docs/interactions/controllers) are available to ease the User interaction with the Agent.
