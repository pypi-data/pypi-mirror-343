# Use Cases

The available [Agents](/docs/agents) support following use cases.

- **Automated Data Analysis** - Generate and execute Python scripts to analyze data, create visualizations, or preprocess datasets.
- **Error Debugging** - Identify and explain errors in code execution, with actionable suggestions to fix them.

We are working on UI to easily interact with the Agents and plan on building new Agents to support more use cases.

- **Creating a UI for Chatting with the Agent in JupyterLab** - Developing an interactive interface within JupyterLab 
where users can directly communicate with the Jupyter AI Agents, issuing commands and receiving real-time responses 
in a conversational format.
- **Building a Code Refactoring Agent** - Developing an agent that can automatically refactor code in Jupyter Notebooks,
improving code quality, readability, and maintainability.
