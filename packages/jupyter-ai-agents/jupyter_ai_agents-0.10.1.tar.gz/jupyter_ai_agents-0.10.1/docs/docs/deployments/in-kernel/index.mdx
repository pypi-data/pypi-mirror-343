# In Kernel

When installed in a Jupyter Kernel, the Agent can be requested directly.

:::warning

This is not the recommended way and should be used only for development purposes.

:::

To install Jupyter AI Agents, run the following command.

```bash
pip install jupyter_ai_agents
```

The Jupyter AI Agents can directly interact with JupyterLab and the modifications made by the Jupyter AI Agents can be seen in real-time thanks to [Jupyter Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html). 

Make sure you have JupyterLab installed with the Collaboration extension.

```bash
pip install jupyterlab jupyter-collaboration ipykernel
```

Start JupyterLab, setting a `port` and a `token` to be reused by the agent, and create a notebook `test.ipynb`.

```bash
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN
```
