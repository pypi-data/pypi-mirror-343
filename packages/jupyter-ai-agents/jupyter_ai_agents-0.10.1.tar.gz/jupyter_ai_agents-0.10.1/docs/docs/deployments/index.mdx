# Deployment

The **Deployment Modes** refer to where the agent is running as well as it capabilities.

- `In-Kernel` - When installed in the Jupyter Kernel, the Agent can be requested directly. This is not the recommended way and should be used only for development purposes.
- `Out-Kernel Stateless` - The Agent can be requested trough CLI for example. In a Stateless it is not possible to leverage the `Agent Memory` features, meaning that the agent does not remember previous interactions.
- `Out-Kernel Stateful` - A separated process that is requested via e.g. REST endpoints, being able to leverage the `Agent Memory` features.
