The examples cover various use cases from basic feature extraction to advanced analyses:

Watershed Analysis
----------------

:doc:`watershed_analysis`

This example demonstrates how to analyze a watershed to extract hydrological variables that can be used for flood susceptibility assessment. It shows the complete workflow from defining a watershed boundary to extracting HAND, EDTW, and Slope values, and finally identifying potential flood-prone areas.

Flood Susceptibility Mapping
--------------------------

:doc:`flood_susceptibility_mapping`

This example shows how to use the extracted hydro-topographic features to create flood susceptibility maps. It combines HAND, EDTW, and Slope values with other datasets like rainfall intensity and land cover to produce a comprehensive flood susceptibility assessment.

Urban Drainage Analysis
---------------------

:doc:`urban_drainage_analysis`

This example focuses on using hydro-topographic features for urban drainage analysis. It shows how to identify potential urban flooding hotspots, analyze flow paths in urban areas, and assist in drainage system planning.

Regional Comparison
----------------

:doc:`regional_comparison`

This example demonstrates how to compare hydro-topographic characteristics across different regions. It shows how to process multiple study areas and analyze statistical differences in HAND, EDTW, and Slope distributions.
