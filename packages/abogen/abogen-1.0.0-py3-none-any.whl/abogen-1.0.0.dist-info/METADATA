Abogen is a powerful text-to-speech conversion tool that makes it easy to turn ePub, PDF, or text files into high-quality audio with matching subtitles in seconds. Use it for audiobooks, voiceovers for Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, or any project that needs natural-sounding text-to-speech, using [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M).

> This demo was generated in just 5Â seconds, producing âˆ¼1Â minute of audio with perfectly synced subtitles. To create a similar video, see [the demo guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizsafak/abogen/refs/heads/main/demo/README.md).

## `How to install?`
### Windows
Go to [espeak-ng latest release](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/latest) download and run the *.msi file.
```bash
# For NVIDIA GPUs:
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install abogen
```
Alternatively, for an easier setup on Windows:
1. [Download](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Run `WINDOWS_INSTALL.bat` by double-clicking it

This method handles everything automatically - installing all dependencies including CUDA in a self-contained environment without requiring a separate Python installation. (You still need to install [espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/latest).)

### Mac
```bash
brew install espeak-ng
pip install abogen # (I have not tested it)
```
### Linux
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install espeak-ng
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S espeak-ng
# Fedora
sudo dnf install espeak-ng
pip install abogen
```
> If you get "No matching distribution found" error, try installing it on supported Python (3.10 to 3.12). You can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage multiple Python versions easily in Linux.

Then simply run by typing:

```bash
abogen
```

## `How to use?`
1) Drag and drop any ePub, PDF, or text file (or use the built-in text editor)
2) Configure the settings:
    - Set speech speed
    - Select a voice
    - Select subtitle generation style (by sentence, word, etc.)
    - Select output format
    - Select where to save the output
3) Hit Start

## `In action`

Hereâ€™s Abogen in action: in this demo, it processes âˆ¼3,000 characters of text in just 11 seconds and turns it into 3 minutes and 28 seconds of audio, and I have a low-end **GTXÂ 2060Â Mobile laptop GPU**. Your results may vary depending on your hardware.

## `Key Features`
- **Supported formats**: `ePub`, `PDF`, or `.TXT` files (or use built-in text editor)
- **Speed**: Adjust speech rate from `0.1x` to `2.0x`
- **Voices**: First letter of the language code (e.g., `a` for American English, `b` for British English, etc.), second letter is for `m` for male and `f` for female.
- **Generate subtitles**: `Disabled`, `Sentence`, `Sentence + Comma`, `1 word`, `2 words`, `3 words`, etc. (Represents the number of words in each subtitle entry)
- **Output formats**: `.WAV`, `.FLAC`, or `.MP3`
- **Save location**: `Save next to input file`, `Save to desktop`, or `Choose output folder`
- **Chapter Control**: Select specific `chapters` from ePUBs or `chapters + pages` from PDFs.
- **Options**:
    - **Configure max words per subtitle**: Automatically configures the maximum number of words per subtitle entry.
    - **Create desktop shortcut**: Creates a shortcut on your desktop for easy access.
    - **Open config.json directory**: Opens the directory where the configuration file is stored.
    - **Open temp directory**: Opens the temporary directory where converted text files are stored.
    - **Clear all teporary files**: Deletes all temporary files created during the conversion process.
    - **Check for updates at startup**: Automatically checks for updates when the program starts.
- **After conversion**: `Open file`, `Go to folder`, `New conversion`, or `Go back`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Subtitle generation currently works only for English. This is because Kokoro provides timestamp tokens only for English text. If you want subtitles in other languages, please request this feature in the [Kokoro project](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro).
