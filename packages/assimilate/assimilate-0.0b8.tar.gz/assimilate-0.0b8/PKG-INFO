*Assimilate* is a simple command line utility to orchestrate backups. It is 
designed to make common tasks simple and efficient.  With *Assimilate*, you 
specify all the details about your backups once in advance, and then use 
a simple command line interface for your day-to-day activities.

*Assimilate* is a front-end to Borg_, a powerful and fast de-duplicating backup 
program.  Use of *Assimilate* does not preclude the use of *Borg* directly on 
the same repository.  The philosophy of *Assimilate* is to provide commands that 
you would use often and in an interactive manner with the expectation that you 
would use Borg directly for the remaining commands.

*Assimilate* is intended for use with Borg_ 2.0 or newer, which is currently not 
available in a stable release and is not recommended for general use.  If you 
are using a earlier version of *Borg* you should consider using Emborg_.  
*Emborg* is the immediate predecessor of *Assimilate*, but *Assimilate* is not 
backward compatible with *Emborg*.

The *help* command provides information on how to use Assimlates's various
