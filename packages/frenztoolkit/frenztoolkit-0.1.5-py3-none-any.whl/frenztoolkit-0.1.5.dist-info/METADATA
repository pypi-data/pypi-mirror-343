# FRENZ TOOLKIT
The Frenz Streaming Toolkit enables scientists to stream data from the Frenz Brainband to their laptop or PC, facilitating the development of custom applications. It provides access to distinct brain signals, offering a valuable alternative to PSG, the gold standard in brain signal recording. [1].

### **I. Getting started**

You can install the Frenz Streaming Toolkit on your PC using pip:

```bash
pip install frenztoolkit
```

Alternatively, you can download the package and build it from source.

**Product Key Requirement**

A valid product key is required to use the toolkit. Please contact our sales department to obtain your product key.

**System Requirements**

Before using the toolkit, ensure you have the following:

- A Frenz Brainband
- A laptop (Mac/Windows/Linux) with Bluetooth and internet connectivity
- A product key (contact Earable’s sales department if you don’t have one)

### **II. Connecting to Your Device**

To connect your Frenz Brainband, you first need to identify its Bluetooth ID. The toolkit provides a `Scanner` utility to help you retrieve this ID.

**Scanning for Available Devices**

```python
from frenztoolkit import Scanner

scanner = Scanner()
print(scanner.scan())
```

**Example Output:**

```python
["DEVICE_1", "DEVICE_2", "DEVICE_3"]
```

This function returns a list of available Frenz Brainbands that are not currently connected to any phone or laptop.

### **III. Start your session**

Once you have the band’s Bluetooth ID, you can start your session.

Refer to the following code snippets for guidance on how to:

- Connect to a Frenz Brainband
- Start a session
- Access real-time data
- Stop a session

```python
import time
from frenztoolkit import Streamer

PRODUCT_KEY = "YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY"
DEVICE_ID = "YOUR_BRAIN_BAND_BLUETOOTH_ID"

# START A SESSION
# Config your streamer
streamer = Streamer(
		device_id = DEVICE_ID, 
    product_key = PRODUCT_KEY,
    data_folder = "./" # The folder stored your 
										   # session data when it be completed
)

# Start a session
streamer.start()

# ACCESS TO DATA
# When the session sucessfully started, 
# you can access to the raw brain signals.
# This is a array shape [4, N] where stored 
# data of 4 channels from the band with ordered
# LF, RF, OTEL, OTER; and the data are continuously
# added to the END of the array.
streamer.DATA["RAW"]["EEG"]

# You also can access to the filtered signals, which have
# applied power-line noise, propriate band-pass filter to 
# remove noises from the signals. 
# The filtered signals is much better for human to read 
# dirrectly.
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.DATA["FILTERED"]["EEG"]

# Similary, you can access to the IMU signals, 
# which is recorded from the IMU sensor.
# The data have a shape of [6, M], stored 6 channels of
# data accordingly: x, y, z, gx, gy, gz; 
# where x, y, z: accelerometers
# and gx, gy, gz: gyroscopes
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.DATA["RAW"]["IMU"]

# You can access to the PPG signals:
# which have shape [3, K], stored data of 3 channel:
# GREEN, RED, INFRARED
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.DATA["RAW"]["PPG"]

# You also can access to the calculated scores
# from our machine learning models:

# POAS: probability of falling asleep
# Shape: [1, N], calculated for every 30 second
# Value: from 0-1
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.SCORES["POAS"]

# posture: posture
# Shape: [1, N], calculated for every 4 second
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.SCORES["posture"]

# eye_gesture
# Shape: [1, N], calculated for every 1 second
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.SCORES["eye_gesture"]

# eye_blink
# Shape: [1, N], calculated for every 1 second
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.SCORES["eye_blink"]

# emg_event_channel
# Shape: [1, N], calculated for every 1 second
# The data are continuously added to the END of the array.
streamer.SCORES["emg_event_channel"]

# To be updated: We still have many more scores.

# STOP YOUR SESSION
# Limit your session by durration
while True:
    if streamer.session_dur > 1000:
        streamer.stop()
        break 
    # YOUR CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THE REALTIME STREAMING DATA HERE
    time.sleep(1)

# Or press[CTRL + Q] for window or [CMD+Q] For Mac to quit the session.
# When the session stoped, raw signals and scores will be stored in the 
# data_folder folder.
```
