## Project Description

>(aka; What are you trying to achieve?):

```txt
Transcribe and convert a SINGLE attached PDF with less 100 pages to Markdown.

Ensure proper Table of Contents, Titles and Subtitles, tables, lists, quotes etc are used and correctly formatted - in this particular case we omit images entirely as they are decorative and superfluous.

Note: Base64 encoding images when not needed will eat up our tokens. The text content for this document is all we output. See (BUT DON'T CHANGE), the system prompt for additional understanding of this project
