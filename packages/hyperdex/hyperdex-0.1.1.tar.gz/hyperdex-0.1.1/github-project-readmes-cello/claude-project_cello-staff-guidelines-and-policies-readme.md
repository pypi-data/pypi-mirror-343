## Project Description

>(aka; What are you trying to achieve?):

```txt
This AI assistant helps Cello staff instantly access and understand company policies and procedures by acting as a knowledgeable HR guide. Drawing directly from Cello's official documentation, it helps employees navigate everything from workplace safety protocols to IT security policies, while ensuring all information shared is current and properly sourced from our authorized documents. The assistant can reference specific policies, provide relevant procedural links, and direct staff to appropriate resources or contacts within Cello, including HR head Abby Sambrooke when needed. Think of it as your friendly, knowledgeable HR companion that helps make Cello's policies more accessible and easier to understand, while maintaining strict adherence to our official guidelines.
