TODO:

- [ ] add requirements.txt file. super simple for this repo
- [ ] install pylance to lint code.
    - [ ] there's quite a few statement errors
    - [ ] some parsing errors etc
- [ ] ensure type checking is used
    - [ ] help catch poor escape sequences in strings etc
- [ ] move into /opt/rancid-auto
- [ ] manually trigger scripts to test
- [ ] add a systemd service file or crons to run the scripts
- [ ] some docstrings would be nice too ...
