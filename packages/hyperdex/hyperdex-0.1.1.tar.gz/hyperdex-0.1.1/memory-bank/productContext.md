# Product Context: hyperdex

## Problem Solved

Managing and staying informed about the status, documentation (READMEs), and release versions across a potentially large number of GitHub repositories (both personal and within an organization like CelloCommunications) can be time-consuming and inefficient. Manually checking each repository for updates, README content, or release status is not scalable. There's a need for an automated way to catalog and access this information centrally.

## How hyperdex Addresses the Problem

hyperdex provides a suite of command-line tools designed to automate the process of interacting with GitHub repositories at scale. It focuses on:

1. **Centralized Indexing:** Creates comprehensive index files (`README.md` and `repositories.csv`) that list targeted repositories along with key metadata (creation/update dates, visibility, latest release/tag). This provides a quick overview without visiting each repository individually.
2. **Local README Caching:** Fetches and stores the `README.md` content from each targeted repository locally, making documentation readily accessible offline and providing a snapshot in time.
3. **Efficient Data Fetching:** Leverages the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and optimized GraphQL queries (where applicable) to retrieve necessary information efficiently, minimizing API calls.
4. **Release Management:** Offers tools to standardize initial releases (`v0.1.0`) for untagged repositories and ensure releases exist for the latest semantic version tags.
5. **Automation:** Integrates with GitHub Actions for scheduled, automated updates of the repository indexes and local README caches.

## User Experience Goals

- **Efficiency:** Save developer time by automating repetitive tasks of checking repository status and documentation.
- **Accessibility:** Provide easy access to README content and key metadata through generated index files and local copies.
- **Consistency:** Ensure a standardized approach to initial releases and maintain up-to-date release information in the index.
- **Reliability:** Offer robust tools with clear status reporting and error handling.
- **Scalability:** Handle a large number of repositories effectively through efficient API usage.
