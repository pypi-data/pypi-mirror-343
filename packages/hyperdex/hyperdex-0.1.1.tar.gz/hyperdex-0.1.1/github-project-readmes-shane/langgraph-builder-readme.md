# LangGraph Builder

LangGraph Builder provides a powerful canvas for designing cognitive architectures of LangGraph applications. After designing an architecture with the canvas, LangGraph Builder enables you to generate boilerplate code for the application in Python and Typescript. Code generation in LangGraph Builder is powered by [langgraph-gen](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-gen-py). Try LangGraph Builder out [here!](https://build.langchain.com)
