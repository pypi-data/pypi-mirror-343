# WarpCore

> Enterprise-grade distributed federated learning platform that utilizes idle computing resources across organizational workstation fleets.

## Vision

WarpCore transforms your organization's idle computing resources into a powerful distributed machine learning infrastructure. Built on the Flower (flwr) framework, it enables federated learning across enterprise workstations while maintaining strict security and user experience standards.

## Project Status: Ideation Phase

This project is currently in the ideation and design phase. We have established:

- Comprehensive architecture design
- Development standards
- Deployment strategies
- Security considerations

We are actively seeking feedback and contributions as we move towards implementation.

## Core Components

### üè∞ Harbor (Server)

Central coordination server that manages:

- Distributed training orchestration
- Model aggregation
- Fleet management
- System monitoring

### üë• Ensign (Client)

Intelligent workstation agent featuring:

- Smart resource monitoring
- Non-intrusive operation
- Secure communication
- Automated task management

## Key Features

- **Smart Resource Utilization**: Automatically detects and utilizes idle computing resources
- **Enterprise Security**: Built-in security features including TLS encryption and certificate-based authentication
- **User-First Design**: Zero impact on employee productivity with intelligent activation triggers
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports standard enterprise deployment tools (SCCM, Intune, Jamf, etc.)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across Windows, macOS, and Linux workstations

## Getting Started

See our [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) for development environment setup instructions.

## Technical Foundation

- **Framework**: Built on Flower (flwr) for federated learning
- **Container Technology**: Incus for deployment management
- **Language**: Python-based implementation
- **Architecture**: Modular design for extensibility
