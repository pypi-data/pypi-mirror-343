Data Classes for SEC Filing Information

This module defines data classes that represent various aspects of SEC filing documents and their associated metadata. These classes are used to structure and manage the data related to SEC filings, including details about specific filings, documents, and the state of filings.

Classes:
--------
1. **FilingsState**: Represents the state of filings for a specific page, including the starting index and total number of filings.
2. **FilingInfo**: Represents detailed information about a specific SEC filing, such as the CIK, accession number, and form type.
3. **FilingDocInfo**: Contains detailed information about a specific SEC filing document, including filing information, file number, IRS number, and SIC code.
4. **FilingTxtDoc**: Represents the raw text content of a filing document, including the document type and filing information.

Detailed Overview:
------------------
The `FilingsState` class is used to track the state of filings on a particular page. It contains the starting index (`page_start`) and the total number of filings available (`num_filings`). This class is useful for managing pagination when retrieving filings.

The `FilingInfo` class stores basic information about a specific SEC filing, such as the Central Index Key (CIK), the accession number assigned by the SEC, and optionally, the form type (e.g., 10-K, 13D, etc.).

The `FilingDocInfo` class provides detailed metadata about a filing document, including references to the associated `FilingInfo`, file number, IRS number, and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.

The `FilingTxtDoc` class is used to represent the text content of a filing document. It includes the document type (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q) and the raw text of the document, along with optional filing information.

Class Usage:
-------------
- **ViewType**: Use this class to know what view to pass
- **FilingsState**: Use this class to manage and track the state of filings, including pagination when retrieving filings from the SEC database.
- **FilingInfo**: This class is helpful for organizing and representing basic metadata about SEC filings, such as CIK, accession number, and form type.
- **FilingDocInfo**: Use this class to store detailed metadata about SEC filing documents, which may include the IRS number, SIC code, and file number.
- **FilingTxtDoc**: This class can be used for managing raw text content of SEC filings and associating it with filing metadata.

Example Usage:
--------------
# Example 1: Creating and using the FilingsState class
filings_state = FilingsState(page_start=1, num_filings=100)

# Example 2: Creating FilingInfo for a specific filing
filing_info = FilingInfo(cik="0000320193", accession_number="0000320193-20-000010", form_type="10-K")

# Example 3: Storing detailed filing document information
filing_doc_info = FilingDocInfo(filing=filing_info, file_number="123456789", IRS="12-3456789", SIC="1234")

# Example 4: Storing a text document for a filing
filing_txt_doc = FilingTxtDoc(doc_type="10-K", raw_txt="This is the raw content of the document.", filing_info=filing_info)
