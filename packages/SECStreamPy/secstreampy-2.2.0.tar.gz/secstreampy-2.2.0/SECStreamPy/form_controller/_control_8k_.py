Modules: _control_8k_.py
=============================
This class is responsible for parsing and extracting sections from a 8-K filing document.
It processes the text content of the document and organizes it into structured sections
that can be further analyzed or manipulated.

Attributes:
- _txt_document (str): The text content of the 8-K filing document to be parsed.

Methods:
- _parse_txt_(): Parses the document text to extract sections, cleaning and organizing them into a PyArrow Table.

The class is a specific implementation of a form strategy, tailored to handle the parsing of
8-K filing documents. It processes the document by identifying section titles and corresponding
content, ensuring the results are returned in a structured format suitable for further analysis.

        Parses the document text and extracts sections into a PyArrow Table.

        The function first trims the text at the position of "SIGNATURES" or "SIGNATURE" if present.
        It then initializes a list to store tuples of (section title, content).
        Next, it finds all matches for the section titles using a predefined pattern.
        For each match, it captures the start and end of the section, extracts the content,
        cleans up the section title and content, and appends them as a tuple to the sections list.
        Finally, it returns the sections as a PyArrow Table.
