# Flexible, scalable, IO library

A IO library is a collection of cells that allows to do the input and output from on-chip signals to outside the chip. Typically these libraries with a fixed set of cells with a fixed layout and functionality and provided by the foundry or a third party.

Purpose of c4m-flexio library is to have a library that is easily scalable between different technologies using the [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) framework. It will also be configurable to adapt the cells to one's needs.

## Release history

* [v0.4.9](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.9):
  * Update for changing API for PDKMaster v0.12.0 and c4m-flexcell v0.4.6
  * Code cleansing
* [v0.4.8](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.8):
  Improve build setup and update dependencies; no functional change.
* [v0.4.7](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.7):
  Remove support for RCClamp resistor drawn as meander; LVS did not work for meander.
* [v0.4.6](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.6):
  Update layout generation for possible DRC violation with new PDKMaster and the allowed reduced dimensions in the PDKs.
* [v0.4.5](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.5):
  * Obey min. width for generated diodes
* [v0.4.4](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.4):
  * IOPadVdd needed another fix as a guard was wrongly connected to vdd
* [v0.4.3](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.3):
  * Critical fix for IOPadVdd layout.
  * make this repo part of project Arrakeen; use common setup like license, DCO check etc.
* [v0.4.2](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexio/-/commits/v0.4.2):
  Several features for IHP SG13G2 support: RCClamp in IOPadVdd, custom layout manipulation
  suport, prefix all cell names.
* v0.4.1:
  Implement layout without the bond pad included and pin that connects to the bond located at the
  bottom of the cell. This also implements ESD using diodes between pad and iovdd/iovdd net.
  This was done during development of IO library for the IHP sg13g2 process.
* v0.4.0:
  started implemented a new layout where no bond pad is present in the IO cell layout. This is for a
  new IO library for the IHP SG13g2 process. This new layout is still considered WIP but the old
  layout with a bond pad included should still be available.  
  This release was made to allow to release a new Sky130 library with latest state of the IO cells
  and updated for the latest version of PDKMaster and c4m-flexcell.
* v0.3.1: no code change; mark IO cell code compatible with dev v0.4.0 of c4m-flexcell
* v0.3.0: Update for [release v0.9.0 of PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster/-/blob/v0.9.0/ReleaseNotes/v0.9.0.md)
* no notes for older releases

## Status

This repository is currently considered experimental code with no backwards compatibility guarantees whatsoever. The library now progresses at the need of other related projects. It has been used to generate
a set of IO cells for the open source IHPSG13G2 process.
