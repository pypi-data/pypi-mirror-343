   ** MACHINE LEARNING NOTES **
 ** INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING **
 ***What is Machine Learning?***
 *   Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building
 systems which can learn from data.
 *   The core idea is to enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task
 through experience (data), without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario.
 *   Instead of writing rigid rules for every situation, ML algorithms learn patterns,
 relationships, and structures within the data.
 *   This allows them to make predictions, classifications, or decisions on new, unseen data.
 *   It's about learning from examples and adapting behavior based on new information


    and many more...
