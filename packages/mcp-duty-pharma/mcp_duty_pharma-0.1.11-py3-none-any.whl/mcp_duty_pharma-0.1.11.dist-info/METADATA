## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lsaavedr/mcp-duty-pharma.git
cd mcp-duty-pharma
```

## 📦 Installation

You can install this MCP server in either Claude Desktop or elsewhere. To use this server, add the following configuration to the settings file:

- in json format

```json
{
  "MCP Duty Pharma": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": ["tool", "run", "mcp_duty_pharma"]
  }
}
```

```

🔒 Safety Features

- Rate Limiting: Each geocoding call is rate-limited (e.g., 1-second delay) to avoid excessive requests that violate usage limits.
- Error Handling: Catches geopy exceptions (timeouts, service errors) and returns safe [] results instead of crashing.
