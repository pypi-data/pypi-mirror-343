> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking changes**
> The client is now asynchronous instead of running the websocket communication in a thread. This is a workaround
> due to the limitation of the underlying code not supporting multi-threading.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Breaking changes :warning:
> The API to create a notebook model client changed to receive directly
> the websocket URL for the notebook. In the case of the Jupyter Server,
> a helper is provided to generate that websocket URL.

```patch
  from jupyter_nbmodel_client import (
      NbModelClient,
+     get_jupyter_notebook_websocket_url
