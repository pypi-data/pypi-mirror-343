```
feat(api-auth): Add JWT token validation middleware

Implement secure JWT token validation with proper error handling and 
expiration checks. Add support for refresh tokens with configurable 
lifetime settings.

Affected files:
- M src/auth/jwt_validator.js
- M src/middleware/auth.js
- + src/utils/token_helpers.js
- M config/auth.json

Fixes #123
```

## How It Works

### Workflow Overview

1. **Load Changes**: Detects all modified and untracked files in the Git repository
2. **Analyze Changes**: Examines each file's content, language, and importance
3. **Group Changes**: Organizes related files into logical, atomic commits
4. **Generate Commit Messages**: Creates detailed, conventional commit messages
5. **Execute Commits**: Handles the git staging and commit process

### Change Analysis

The tool analyzes changes through multiple dimensions:

- **File Status**: Checks if files are modified, added, or deleted
- **Language Detection**: Identifies programming languages based on file extensions
- **Component Recognition**: Maps files to logical components (e.g., docs, tests, api)
- **Tech Stack Detection**: Detects project technologies (e.g., Python, Node.js, React)
- **Importance Rating**: With AI, assesses the impact and significance of each change

### Intelligent Grouping

Changes are grouped based on:

- **Component Coherence**: Files from the same component are grouped together
- **Logical Relationship**: AI analyzes file dependencies and relationships
- **Change Size Management**: Large groups are split into smaller, coherent commits
- **Commit Type Assignment**: Each group is assigned a conventional commit type (feat, fix, etc.)

### Ollama LLM Integration

When using AI mode (default):

1. Smart Git Commit connects to Ollama's API
2. Available LLM models are detected automatically
3. The selected model analyzes file changes and content
4. AI determines logical groupings and generates commit descriptions
5. GPU acceleration is used when available

### Non-AI Fallback

When AI is unavailable or disabled:

1. Files are grouped by component/directory
2. Commit types are assigned based on file paths and extensions
3. Basic commit messages are generated using rule-based templates
4. The user can interactively refine the commit details

### Interactive Workflow

In interactive mode (default):

1. Each commit group is presented for review
2. You can approve, skip, or edit the commit details
3. Edit options include changing the commit name, type, description, and issue references
4. The tool handles staging and committing the files
5. You can review the final commit before proceeding to the next group

## Project Structure

- **`CommitType` Enum**: Defines conventional commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **`GitChange` Class**: Represents a changed file with metadata
- **`CommitGroup` Class**: Groups related changes for a single commit
- **`OllamaClient` Class**: Handles communication with Ollama API
- **`SmartGitCommitWorkflow` Class**: Orchestrates the entire commit process

## Advanced Usage

### Using Custom Ollama Endpoints

```bash
# Use a different Ollama host
smart-git-commit --ollama-host http://custom-ollama-server:11434
```

### Non-Interactive Automation

```bash
# For CI/CD or automated scripts
smart-git-commit --non-interactive
```

### Working with Multiple Repositories

```bash
# Specify the repository path
smart-git-commit --repo-path /path/to/your/repository
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Error: "Not a git repository"
- Ensure you're running the command from within a git repository
- If needed, initialize a new git repository with `git init`
- Verify that the `.git` directory exists and is accessible

#### Error: "Repository path does not exist"
- Check that the specified path exists when using `--repo-path`
- Use absolute paths if relative paths aren't working correctly

#### Error: "Git is not properly configured"
- Git requires user.name and user.email to be set before committing
- Configure with:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

#### Error: "Failed to stage files"
- When running from a subdirectory, use the `--repo-path` argument to specify the git root directory:
  ```bash
  # If you're in a subdirectory like 'backend'
  smart-git-commit --repo-path ..
  ```
- Ensure you have write access to the repository files

#### Error: "No models found in Ollama"
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check that you have at least one model installed: `ollama list`
- If no models are available, pull one: `ollama pull llama3`

#### Error: "Failed to get models from Ollama API"
- Check that the Ollama server is accessible on the specified host
- Default location is http://localhost:11434
- Verify your network connection allows access to the Ollama server
- Try restarting the Ollama server: `ollama serve`

#### Error: "Failed to generate text with Ollama"
- The model might be too large for your hardware
- Try a smaller model like gemma:2b or tinyllama
- Check Ollama server logs for any errors or memory issues

#### Connection Timeouts
- If you experience connection timeouts with Ollama, you can adjust the timeout parameter:
  ```bash
  # Increase the timeout to 30 seconds
  smart-git-commit --timeout 30
  ```
- For slow networks or large models, a longer timeout may be necessary

#### Error: "No module named pre_commit"
- This occurs when your repository has pre-commit hooks configured but the pre-commit Python module is not installed
- Solutions:
  1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
  2. Skip the hooks: `smart-git-commit --skip-hooks`
  3. Remove pre-commit hooks from the repository if not needed

### Command-Line Debugging

For more detailed information when errors occur, use the `--verbose` flag:

```bash
smart-git-commit --verbose
```

This will show additional debugging information that can help diagnose issues.

### Ollama Connection Issues

If you encounter issues connecting to Ollama:

1. Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
2. Check that you have at least one model: `ollama list`
3. Try specifying the host explicitly: `--ollama-host http://localhost:11434`
4. Check for firewall or network issues if using a remote server

### Falling Back to Non-AI Mode

If AI analysis isn't working properly:

```bash
# Run with fallback mode explicitly
smart-git-commit --no-ai
```

## System Requirements

- **Minimum**: Python 3.7+, Git, 4GB RAM
- **Recommended for AI mode**:
  - 8GB+ RAM
  - An Ollama-compatible system
  - Internet connection (for initial model download)

## To-Do / Future Features

Here are some planned enhancements and features for future releases:

- [ ] **GitHub/GitLab Integration**: Automatic issue linking and PR description generation
- [ ] **Commit Squashing**: Intelligently squash related commits for cleaner history
- [ ] **Multiple AI Backends**: Support for additional AI providers beyond Ollama (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models)
- [ ] **Interactive TUI Mode**: Text-based user interface for easier navigation through changes
- [ ] **Custom Commit Templates**: Support for user-defined commit templates and conventions
- [ ] **Config File Support**: Persistent user configurations and project-specific settings
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hook Integration**: Run as a Git hook for seamless workflow integration
- [ ] **Bulk Processing Mode**: Process multiple repositories in batch mode for organization-wide standards
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow extensions to add custom functionality
- [x] **Performance Optimization**: Faster processing of large repositories with many changes
