A command-line interface (CLI) application to keep track of your tasks, their starting time, finishing time and their
durations. The CLI uses a SQLite DB to store data.
## Installation

You can install the package using either `pipx` or `pip`.

> **Note**: It is highly recommended to install this package using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/). It provides
> an isolated environment for installing and managing command-line tools. It also simplifies running CLIs without
> activating a virtual environment.  
> [Check out this page](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/comparisons/) to compare **pip** and **pipx**.

### Using pipx (recommended)

```shell
pipx install simple-task-tracker
```

### Using pip

```shell
pip install simple-task-tracker
```

## Usage

After the installation, you can run the CLI application with the following command:

```shell
tt help
```

This will display the list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Commands

- `tt active`:   (or **"a"**) List all active tasks.
