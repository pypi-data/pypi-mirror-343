## Usage
First, create an instance and check the registered unit names.
```python
from UnitCvrt import UnitConv as uc
conv=uc.Convert()
conv.Registered()
```
Select a unit name from the list of registered units, then convert it using the following steps.
The example below demonstrates how to convert 1 meter to inch for the case of length.
```python
conv.SetUnit('Length')
conv.Eval('m','in',1)
```
You can output the unit conversion table using the following command. You can check the unit names from this output.
```python
conv.Table()
```
Finally, you need to destroy the created instance using the following command.
```python
conv.DelUnit()
```
