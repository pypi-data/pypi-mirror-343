## Features
- **Type-Safe CRUD Operations**: Built with Python type hints and generics for robust type checking
- **SQLAlchemy Integration**: Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy for database operations
- **Redis Caching**: Integrated Redis caching with automatic cache invalidation
- **Async Support**: Fully asynchronous operations using SQLAlchemy async ORM and Redis
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination support with customizable limits and page numbers
- **Pydantic Integration**: Seamless integration with Pydantic for schema validation
- **Generic Base Class**: Extensible base class for creating custom CRUD operations
- **Automatic Cache Management**: Smart cache invalidation on data modifications
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with custom exceptions

## Note 
- âš¡ FastRDB is designed with FastAPI (Fastest Python Web Framework) in mind, providing optimal support for asynchronous operations, dependency injection, and Pydantic-based validation.

- However, FastRDB is framework-agnostic â€” you can use it with any Python async environment (such as plain asyncio, Quart, Starlette, etc.), as long as you're using SQLAlchemy's async ORM.

- Whether you're building REST APIs, microservices, or internal tooling, FastRDB can boost your productivity with clean and reusable CRUD operations. ðŸ’¡

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- SQLAlchemy
- Redis
- Pydantic
- orjson

*You only need to ensure Python version compatibility. All other dependencies will be installed automatically with FastRDB.*

## Installation

 - Using uv

First create a virtual environment and activate it<br> 
<i> (if not already done and it's a good practice to keep your dependencies in a virtual environment) </i> :
    
```console
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate 
```

Install FastRDB:
```console
uv pip install fastrdb
```


 - Using pip

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    
```console
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install FastRDB:

```console
pip install fastrdb
```
Now you are ready to use FastRDB! ðŸ¤©
