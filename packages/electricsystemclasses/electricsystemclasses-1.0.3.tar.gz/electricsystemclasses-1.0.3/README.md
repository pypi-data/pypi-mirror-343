# ElectricSystemClasses

A Python package providing a collection of classes for simulating electric systems. The library includes components like electric vehicles (EVs), generators, grids, storage systems, and loads. 
It is designed for use in simulations and modeling of power systems, focusing on flexible, easy-to-use components for energy management scenarios.

## Features

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: Model and manage electric vehicle characteristics such as power, state-of-charge, and classification.
- **Generators**: Simulate electricity generation profiles, including scaling and adjusting the length of the profiles.
- **Grid**: Model the power exchange between the system and the grid, tracking the energy flow.
- **Storage Systems**: Simulate energy storage components, including charging and discharging behaviors.
- **Constant Load**: A basic class for representing time-invariant loads.
- **Programmable Load**: A class for representing time-programmed loads.
- **Programmable Load With Activation**: A class for representing time-programmed loads with reactivation available.
