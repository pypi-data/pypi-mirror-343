"""
Utilities for resolving and traversing references within a hierarchical namespace system.

This module provides functions to resolve references to objects within a complex namespace represented by a hub.
These utilities are crucial for navigating through nested structures, allowing easy access to any object by its
"path" in the namespace hierarchy. Functions in this module support resolving references from string identifiers,
facilitating dynamic access to components across the system.

Functions:
    - last: Returns the last object in a reference chain, facilitating direct access to the desired endpoint.
    - path: Provides a list of all objects from the hub up to a specified reference, enabling traceability of the access path.
    - find: Parses a dot-separated reference string and retrieves the corresponding object from the hub, handling nested structures.

These functions are typically used in systems where components are dynamically managed and accessed through a centralized hub,
enabling flexible and maintainable access patterns across a pluggably-structured application.

def last(hub, ref) -> object:
    """
    Retrieve the last object from a reference path within the hub.

    Parameters:
        hub (pns.hub.Hub): The central hub or root namespace.
        ref (str): A dot-separated string representing the path to the object.

    Returns:
        object: The last object referenced by `ref`.

    Example:
        >>> last(hub, "sub1.sub2.mod")

    Generate a list of objects that form the path to a specific reference within the hub.

    Parameters:
        hub (pns.hub.Hub): The central hub or root namespace.
        ref (str): A dot-separated string that specifies the path through the hub.

    Returns:
        list[object]: A list containing each object along the path specified by `ref`.
