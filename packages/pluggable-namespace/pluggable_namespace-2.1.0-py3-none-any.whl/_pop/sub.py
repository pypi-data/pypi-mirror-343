"""
Module for managing and dynamically loading subsystems within the Plugin Oriented Programming (POP) hub.

This module provides functionality to add new subsystems, reload existing ones, and manage dynamic
subdirectory loading. It is designed to enhance modularity and flexibility in applications using the
POP framework by allowing runtime additions and updates to the hub's subsystems. This capability
supports dynamic development environments and simplifies updates in long-running applications.

    Adds a new subsystem to the hub or extends an existing subsystem with additional directories.

    This function dynamically loads a subsystem into the hub's namespace, optionally including additional

    Parameters:
        hub (pns.hub.Hub): The central hub instance to which the subsystem is added.
        name (str, optional): The name of the subsystem. If not specified, the name is derived from the first
            directory's stem in the provided locations list.
