# Data types
# ----------
# command with alternatives:
#   One or more commands separated by ||. The first command where the
#   program is installed is executed. The other commands are ignored.

#   If the command name starts with a '$' it is interpreted as an
#   environment variable containing the name of the program to be
#   executed. This is useful to make use of environment variables like
#   EDITOR. If the environment variable is not set the program is
#   considered to not be installed and the next command is tried
#   instead.

#   The command is executed without a shell so redirection or wildcard
#   expansion is not possible. Setting environment variables and
#   piping like in a POSIX shell, however, are implemented in python
#   and should work platform independently. If you need a shell write
#   the command to a file, insert an appropriate shebang line, make
#   the file executable and set this value to the file.

# optional existing directory:
#   The path to an existing directory or an empty str to use a default
#   path.

# str:
#   A text. If it contains spaces it must be wrapped in single or
#   double quotes.

# editor
# ------
# a command with alternatives
# The editor to be used when opening the config file.
set editor = "'$EDITOR' fn||rifle fn||vim fn||nano fn||vi fn"

# greeting
# --------
# a str
# This setting is defined in the example and is not a standard setting
# defined by quickstart.
set greeting = 'hello world'

# include.extensions
# ------------------
# a comma separated list of str
# File extensions to be suggested for auto completion of the include
# command. An empty list means all files with any extensions are
# suggested. The extensions should include the leading full stop. The
# check is case insensitive.
set include.extensions = ''

# include.home
# ------------
# an optional existing directory
# The directory where the include command looks for relative paths. An
# empty string is the default, the directory where the config file is
# located.
set include.home = ''

# notification-level.config-file
# ------------------------------
# one of info, error
set notification-level.config-file = error

# notification-level.user-interface
# ---------------------------------
# one of info, error
set notification-level.user-interface = info
