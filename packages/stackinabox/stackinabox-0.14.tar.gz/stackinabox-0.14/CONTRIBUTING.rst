Contributors, Welcome!

Come on in and contribute! StackInABox is looking to grow, and
it needs your help. This document is a guide to making **really**
successful contributions.

=======================
A Little Bit of Process
=======================

----------------
We've Got Issues
----------------

Check out the `Issues`_ and `Milestones`_ tabs. They offer great
starting points for making an effective contribution. If you find an
issue or think of something that you'd like to see in the stack, the
`Issues`_ page is the place to put it.

Feedback counts as a contribution, too, and it's the easiest one you
can make.

-------
Reviews
-------

Except for feedback, every contribution begins with a pull request. In
order to keep knowledge of StackInABox  distributed, we encourage
code review here.

-------
Testing
-------

We are aiming for 100% unit test coverage. Presently we have about 74%
coverage. Once 100% test coverage is achieved then it will be required -
no questions asked. Until then, please help us achieve that or at a minimum
maintain the status quo.

To be clear about definitions, a unit test is one that:

* Tests expected functionality
* Does not utilize unpredictable functionality (e.g., time.time)

To run tests::

	tox

Code

Please keep all work in a branch. This makes it easy to add/remove changes
and track the history.

Style

To be sure your contributions are compliant::

    tox -e pep8

Misc.
-----

Here are the tenants in order of importance:

* Correctness - incorrect code is useless
* Simplicity - easy to use, easy to understand
* Consistentency - new interfaces should feel like existing interfaces
* Easy of use - users will only use it if it's easy and not burdensome
* Performance - almost doesn't matter. "Optimization is the root of all evil".
    - Address performance when it becomes a problem. Don't make it a
      problem before it is.
* Few dependencies - must be simple, explicit and not require a lot of things to be installed
	- Reduces the potential for issues with other projects
	- Keeps the ability to integrate into other projects high
