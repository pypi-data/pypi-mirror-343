***THIS PROJECT IS EXPERIMENTAL, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK***

**HakuRiver** is a lightweight, self-hosted cluster manager designed for distributing command-line tasks across compute nodes. It primarily leverages **Docker** to manage reproducible task environments, allowing users to treat containers like portable "virtual environments". HakuRiver orchestrates the creation, packaging (via tarballs), distribution, and execution of these containerized environments across your nodes.

It provides resource allocation (CPU/memory/GPU limits), multi-node/NUMA/GPU task submission, and status tracking, making it ideal for research labs, small-to-medium teams, home labs, or development environments needing simple, reproducible distributed task execution without the overhead of complex HPC schedulers.

## Introduction to HakuRiver

### Problem Statement

Researchers and small teams often face a challenging middle ground when working with a modest number of compute nodes (typically 3-8 machines). This creates an awkward situation:

- **Too many machines** to manage manually with SSH and shell scripts
- **Too few machines** to justify the overhead of complex HPC schedulers like Slurm
- **Unsuitable complexity** of container orchestration systems like Kubernetes for simple task distribution

You have these powerful compute resources at your disposal, but no efficient way to utilize them as a unified computing resource without significant operational overhead.

### Core Concept: Your Nodes as One Big Computer

HakuRiver addresses this problem by letting you treat your small cluster as a single powerful computer, with these key design principles:

- **Lightweight Resource Management**: Distribute command-line tasks across your nodes with minimal setup
- **Environment Consistency**: Use Docker containers as portable virtual environments, not as complex application deployments
- **Seamless Synchronization**: Automatically distribute container environments to runners without manual setup on each node
- **Familiar Workflow**: Submit tasks through a simple interface that feels like running a command on your local machine

> Docker in HakuRiver functions as a virtual environment that can be dynamically adjusted and automatically synchronized. You can run dozens of tasks using the same container environment, but execute them on completely different nodes.

### How It Works

1.  **Environment Management**: Create and customize Docker containers on the Host node using `hakuriver.docker` commands and interactive shells (`hakuriver.docker-shell`).
2.  **Package & Distribute**: The environment is packaged as a tarball using `hakuriver.docker create-tar` and stored in shared storage.
3.  **Automatic Synchronization**: Runner nodes automatically fetch the required environment from shared storage before executing tasks.
4.  **Parallel Execution**: Submit single commands or batches to run across multiple nodes, with each task isolated in its own container instance (or executed directly via systemd).

This approach aligns with the philosophy that:

> For a small local cluster, you should prioritize solutions that are "lightweight, simple, and just sufficient." You shouldn't need to package every command into a complex Dockerfile - Docker's purpose here is environment management and synchronization.

HakuRiver is built on the assumption that in small local clusters:

- Nodes can easily establish network communication
- Shared storage is readily available
- Doesn't require authentication or the complexity can be minimized
- High availability and fault tolerance are less critical at this scale

By focusing on these practical realities of small-scale computing, HakuRiver provides a "just right" solution for multi-node task execution without the administrative burden of enterprise-grade systems.

## ✨ Features

*   **Managed Docker Environment Workflow:**
    *   Set up persistent base containers on the Host (`hakuriver.docker create-container`).
    *   Interact with/install software in Host containers (`hakuriver.docker-shell`).
    *   Commit and package environments into versioned tarballs (`hakuriver.docker create-tar`).
    *   Place tarballs in shared storage for Runners.
*   **Containerized Task Execution:** Tasks run inside specified Docker environments (managed by HakuRiver).
*   **Automated Environment Sync:** Runners automatically check and sync the required container tarball version from shared storage before running a task.
*   **Systemd Fallback Execution:** Option (`--container NULL`) to run tasks directly on the node using the system's service manager (`systemd-run --scope`) for system-level access or when Docker isn't needed.
*   **CPU/RAM Resource Allocation:** Jobs request CPU cores (`--cores`) and memory limits (`--memory`) for both Docker and Systemd tasks.
*   **NUMA Node Targeting:** Optionally bind *systemd-run* tasks to specific NUMA nodes (`--target node:numa_id`). (NUMA in Docker is TODO).
*   **GPU Resource Allocation (New!):** Request specific GPU devices (`--target node::gpu_id1,gpu_id2...`) on target nodes for Docker tasks. Runners report available GPUs via heartbeats.
*   **Multi-Node/NUMA/GPU Task Submission:** Submit a single request (`hakuriver.client`) to run the same command across multiple specified nodes, specific NUMA nodes, or specific GPU devices.
*   **Persistent Task & Node Records:** Host maintains an SQLite DB of nodes (including detected NUMA topology and GPU info) and tasks (status, target, resources, logs, container used).
*   **Node Health & Resource Awareness:** Basic heartbeat detects offline runners. Runners report overall CPU/Memory usage, NUMA topology, and GPU details.
*   **Web Dashboard (Experimental):** Vue.js frontend for visual monitoring, task submission (incl. multi-target and container/GPU selection), status checks, and killing tasks. Includes web-based terminal access to Host containers and log viewing modals.
*   **Standalone Argument Spanning (`hakurun`):** Utility for local parameter sweeps before submitting to the cluster.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

*   Python >= 3.10
*   Access to a shared filesystem mounted on the Host and all Runner nodes.
*   **Host Node:** Docker Engine installed (for managing environments and creating tarballs).
*   **Runner Nodes:** **Docker Engine** installed (for executing containerized tasks). `numactl` is optional (only needed for the systemd/NUMA fallback). `pynvml` and NVIDIA drivers are optional (only needed for GPU reporting/allocation). Passwordless `sudo` access might be required for the runner user depending on Docker setup (`docker` commands) or if using the systemd fallback (`systemd-run`, `systemctl`).
*   **Docker Engine**: You don't need any addition configuration for Docker beside just install them, but ensure the data-root and storage driver are set up correctly. HakuRiver uses the default Docker storage driver and data-root (`/var/lib/docker`), but you can change this in the Docker daemon configuration if needed. run `docker run hello-world` to verify Docker is working correctly.

### Steps

1.  **Install HakuRiver** (on Host, Runners, and Client machine):
    ```bash
    # Using pip (recommended)
    python -m pip install hakuriver
    # To include GPU monitoring support on Runners (requires pynvml & nvidia drivers)
    # python -m pip install "hakuriver[gpu]"

    # Or install from source (latest version)
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/HakuRiver.git
    # For GPU support from source
    # python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/HakuRiver.git#egg=hakuriver[gpu]"

    # Or clone and install locally
    # git clone https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/HakuRiver.git
    # cd HakuRiver
    # pip install .
    # For GPU support locally
    # pip install ".[gpu]"
    ```
2.  **Configure HakuRiver** (on Host, Runners, and Client):
    *   Create the default config file:
        ```bash
        hakuriver.init config
        ```
    *   Edit the configuration file (`~/.hakuriver/config.toml`):
        ```bash
        vim ~/.hakuriver/config.toml
        ```
    *   **Crucial**: set `host_reachable_address` to the Host's IP/hostname accessible by Runners/Clients.
    *   **Crucial**: Set `runner_address` to the Runner's IP/hostname accessible by the Host (must be unique per Runner).
    *   **Crucial**: Set `shared_dir` to the absolute path of your shared storage (e.g., `/mnt/shared/hakuriver`). Ensure this directory exists and is writable by the user running HakuRiver components.
    *   Adjust other settings like ports, Docker defaults, `numactl_path` (if using Systemd/NUMA fallback), `local_temp_dir`, etc., as needed. (See Configuration section below for details).

3.  **Start Host Server** (on the manager node):
    ```bash
    hakuriver.host
    # (Optional) Use a specific config: hakuriver.host --config /path/to/host.toml
    ```
    *   **For Systemd:**
        ```bash
        hakuriver.init service --host [--config /path/to/host.toml]
        sudo systemctl restart hakuriver-host.service
        sudo systemctl enable hakuriver-host.service
        ```

4.  **Start Runner Agents** (on each compute node):
    ```bash
    # Ensure Docker is running and the user can access it, or use passwordless sudo for Docker/Systemd commands.
    # Ensure pynvml is installed and drivers are loaded if using GPUs.
    hakuriver.runner
    # (Optional) Use a specific config: hakuriver.runner --config /path/to/runner.toml
    ```
    *   **For Systemd:**
        ```bash
        hakuriver.init service --runner [--config /path/to/runner.toml]
        sudo systemctl restart hakuriver-runner.service
        sudo systemctl enable hakuriver-runner.service
        ```

5.  **(Optional) Prepare a Docker Environment** (on the Client/Host):
    *   Create a base container on the Host: `hakuriver.docker create-container python:3.12-slim my-py312-env`
    *   Install software interactively: `hakuriver.docker-shell my-py312-env` (then `pip install ...`, `apt install ...`, `exit`)
    *   Package it into a tarball: `hakuriver.docker create-tar my-py312-env` (creates tarball in shared storage)

6.  **Submit Your First Task** (from the Client machine):
    ```bash
    # Submit a simple echo command using the default Docker env to node1
    hakuriver.client --target node1 -- echo "Hello HakuRiver!"

    # Submit a Python script using your custom env on node2 with 2 cores
    # (Assuming myscript.py is in the shared dir, accessible via /shared)
    hakuriver.client --target node2 --cores 2 --container my-py312-env -- python /shared/myscript.py --input /shared/data.csv

    # Submit a GPU task to node3 using GPU 0 and 1
    hakuriver.client --target node3::0,1 --container my-cuda-env -- python /shared/train_gpu_model.py

    # Submit a system command directly on node4 (no Docker)
    hakuriver.client --target node4 --container NULL -- df -h /
    ```
    Note the `--` separator before your command and arguments.

7.  **Monitor and Manage**:
    *   List nodes: `hakuriver.client --list-nodes`
    *   Check task status: `hakuriver.client --status <task_id>`
    *   Kill a task: `hakuriver.client --kill <task_id>`
    *   Pause/Resume a task: `hakuriver.client pause <task_id>`, `hakuriver.client resume <task_id>` (if supported by runner)
    *   (Optional) Access the Web UI (see Frontend section).

This guide provides the basic steps. Refer to the sections below for detailed explanations of configuration, Docker workflow, and advanced usage.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
![](image/README/HakuRiverArch.jpg)

*   **Host (`hakuriver.host`):** Central coordinator (FastAPI).
    *   Manages node registration (incl. NUMA topology, GPU info).
    *   Manages **Docker environments**: Creates/starts/stops/deletes persistent Host containers, commits/creates versioned tarballs in shared storage.
    *   Provides **WebSocket terminal** access into managed Host containers.
    *   Tracks node status/resources via heartbeats.
    *   Stores node/task info in SQLite DB.
    *   Receives task submissions (incl. multi-target, container/GPU selection).
    *   Validates targets, assigns tasks to Runners (providing Docker image tag or specifying systemd fallback).
*   **Runner (`hakuriver.runner`):** Agent on compute nodes (FastAPI).
    *   Requires **Docker Engine** installed. `systemd` and `numactl` are optional dependencies for systemd fallback. `pynvml` is optional for GPU monitoring.
    *   Registers with Host (reporting cores, RAM, NUMA info, GPU info, URL).
    *   Sends periodic heartbeats (incl. CPU/Mem/GPU usage, Temps).
    *   **Executes tasks:**
        *   **Primary (Docker):** Checks for required container tarball in shared storage, syncs if needed (`docker load`), runs task via `docker run --rm` with specified image, resource limits (`--cpus`, `--memory`, `--gpus`), and mounts.
        *   **Fallback (Systemd):** If `--container NULL` specified, runs task via `sudo systemd-run --scope` with resource limits (`CPUQuota`, `MemoryMax`) and optional `numactl` binding (`--target node:numa_id`).
    *   Reports task status updates back to Host.
    *   Handles kill/pause/resume signals from Host (translating to `docker kill/pause/unpause` or `systemctl stop/kill`).
    *   **Requires passwordless `sudo`** for `systemctl` (if using systemd fallback) or potentially for `docker` commands depending on setup.
*   **Client (`hakuriver.client`, `hakuriver.docker`, `hakuriver.docker-shell`):** CLI tools.
    *   Communicate with Host to submit tasks (specifying command, args, resources, **Docker container name**, and **one or more targets** including node, NUMA, or GPU).
    *   Query task/node status, get health info.
    *   Kill/Pause/Resume tasks.
    *   Manage Host-side Docker containers and environment tarballs.
    *   Access interactive shell in Host containers.
*   **Frontend:** Optional web UI providing visual overview and interaction similar to the Client.
*   **Database:** Host uses SQLite via Peewee to store node inventory (incl. NUMA topology, GPU info) and task details (incl. target NUMA ID, required GPUs, batch ID, container used).
*   **Storage:**
    *   **Shared (`shared_dir`):** Mounted on Host and all Runners. Essential for **container tarballs**, task output logs (`*.out`, `*.err`), and potentially shared scripts/data (mounted as `/shared` in Docker tasks).
    *   **Local Temp (`local_temp_dir`):** Node-specific fast storage, path injected as `HAKURIVER_LOCAL_TEMP_DIR` env var for tasks (mounted as `/local_temp` in Docker tasks).

## 🐳 Docker-Based Environment Workflow

HakuRiver uses Docker containers as portable "virtual environments". Here's the typical workflow, triggered by `hakuriver.docker` commands on the Client (which communicate with the Host) or automatically by the Runner:

1.  **Prepare Base Environment (executed by Host):**
    *   Use `hakuriver.docker create-container <image> <env_name>` to create a persistent container on the Host machine from a base image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `python:3.11`).
    *   Use `hakuriver.docker start-container <env_name>` if it's stopped.
    *   Use `hakuriver.docker-shell <env_name>` to get an interactive shell inside the container. Install necessary packages (`apt install ...`, `pip install ...`), configure files, etc.
2.  **Package the Environment (executed by Host):**
    *   Once the environment is set up, use `hakuriver.docker create-tar <env_name>`.
    *   This commits the container state to a new Docker image (`hakuriver/<env_name>:base`) and saves it as a timestamped `.tar` file in the configured `shared_dir/hakuriver-containers/`. Older tarballs for the same environment are automatically cleaned up.
3.  **Runner Synchronization (Automatic):**
    *   When a task is submitted targeting a Runner and specifying `--container <env_name>`, the Runner checks its local Docker images.
    *   If the required image (`hakuriver/<env_name>:base`) is missing or outdated compared to the latest tarball in `shared_dir`, the Runner automatically loads the latest `.tar` file into its Docker registry.
4.  **Task Execution (on Runner):**
    *   The Runner executes the submitted command inside a *temporary* container created from the synced `hakuriver/<env_name>:base` image using `docker run --rm ...`.
    *   Resource limits (`--cpus`, `--memory`, `--gpus`), the shared directory (`/shared`), local temp (`/local_temp`), and any extra mounts are applied.

This workflow ensures tasks run in consistent, pre-configured environments across all nodes without requiring manual setup on each Runner beyond installing the Docker engine and relevant drivers (like for GPUs).

## `hakurun`: Local Argument Spanning Utility

`hakurun` is a **local helper utility** for testing commands or Python scripts with multiple argument combinations *before* submitting them to the HakuRiver cluster. It does **not** interact with the cluster itself.

*   **Argument Spanning:**
    *   `span:{start..end}` -> Integers (e.g., `span:{1..3}` -> `1`, `2`, `3`)
    *   `span:[a,b,c]` -> List items (e.g., `span:[foo,bar]` -> `"foo"`, `"bar"`)
*   **Execution:** Runs the Cartesian product of all spanned arguments. Use `--parallel` to run combinations concurrently via local subprocesses.
*   **Targets:** Runs Python modules (`mymod`), functions (`mymod:myfunc`), or executables (`python script.py`, `my_executable`).

**Example (`demo_hakurun.py`):**

```python
# demo_hakurun.py
import sys, time, random, os
time.sleep(random.random() * 0.1)
# Print arguments received from hakurun (sys.argv[0] is the script name)
print(f"Args: {sys.argv[1:]}, PID: {os.getpid()}")
```

```bash
# Runs 2 * 1 * 2 = 4 tasks locally and in parallel
hakurun --parallel python ./demo_hakurun.py span:{1..2} fixed_arg span:[input_a,input_b]
```

Use `hakurun` to generate commands you might later submit individually or as a batch using `hakuriver.client` to run *within* a specific Docker environment on the cluster.

## 🔧 Configuration - HakuRiver

*   Create a default config: `hakuriver.init config`. This creates `~/.hakuriver/config.toml`.
*   Review and edit the default config (`src/hakuriver/utils/default_config.toml` shows defaults).
*   Override with `--config /path/to/custom.toml` for any `hakuriver.*` command.
*   **CRITICAL SETTINGS TO REVIEW/EDIT:**
    *   `[network] host_reachable_address`: **Must** be the IP/hostname of the Host reachable by Runners and Clients.
    *   `[network] runner_address`: **Must** be the IP/hostname of the Runner reachable by Host. (Needs to be unique per Runner).
    *   `[paths] shared_dir`: Absolute path to shared storage (must exist and be writable on Host and Runner nodes). **Crucial for logs and container tarballs.**
    *   `[paths] local_temp_dir`: Absolute path to local temp storage (must exist and be writable on Runner nodes). Injected into containers as `/local_temp`.
    *   `[paths] numactl_path`: Absolute path to `numactl` executable on Runner nodes (only needed for systemd fallback).
    *   `[docker] container_dir`: Subdirectory within `shared_dir` for container tarballs.
    *   `[docker] default_container_name`: Default environment name if `--container` isn't specified during task submission.
    *   `[docker] initial_base_image`: Public Docker image used to create the default tarball if it doesn't exist on Host start.
    *   `[docker] tasks_privileged`: Default setting for running containers with `--privileged`.
    *   `[docker] additional_mounts`: List of default "host:container" mounts for tasks.
    *   `[database] db_file`: Path for the Host's SQLite database. Ensure the directory exists.

## 💻 Usage - HakuRiver Cluster (CLI)

This section details the core commands for setting up, managing environments, and running tasks using the command-line interface.

### Initial Setup

Follow the **Quick Start Guide** above for installation, configuration, and starting the Host/Runners.

### Managing Docker Environments

HakuRiver allows you to manage Docker environments directly on the Host, package them, and distribute them via shared storage using the `hakuriver.docker` and `hakuriver.docker-shell` commands.

**Docker Management Command Reference:**

| Action                        | Command Example                                             | Notes                                                           |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List Host Containers          | `hakuriver.docker list-containers`                         | Shows persistent containers on the Host.                       |
| Create Host Container         | `hakuriver.docker create-container <image> <env_name>`      | Creates a container on Host from `<image>`.                     |
| Start Host Container          | `hakuriver.docker start-container <env_name>`              | Starts the container if stopped.                                |
| Stop Host Container           | `hakuriver.docker stop-container <env_name>`               | Stops the container.                                            |
| Interactive Shell             | `hakuriver.docker-shell <env_name>`                        | Opens interactive shell inside the Host container.              |
| Create/Update Tarball         | `hakuriver.docker create-tar <env_name>`                   | Commits container, creates/updates tarball in `shared_dir`.     |
| List Available Tarballs       | `hakuriver.docker list-tars`                               | Shows packaged environments in `shared_dir`.                  |
| Delete Host Container         | `hakuriver.docker delete-container <env_name>`             | Deletes the persistent container from Host (tarball remains). |

### Submitting and Managing Tasks

Use `hakuriver.client` to interact with the cluster and submit tasks.

**Example Task Submissions:**

*   **Run a script in your custom Python environment on node1:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client --target node1 --container my-py311-env -- python /shared/analyze_data.py --input data.csv
    ```
    *(Assumes `analyze_data.py` is accessible at `/shared/analyze_data.py` inside the container, which usually maps to your `shared_dir`)*

*   **Run a command using the default environment across multiple nodes:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client --target node1 --target node3 --cores 2 -- memory 512M -- my_processing_tool --verbose /shared/input_file
    ```
    *(Uses the `default_container_name` from config, allocates 2 cores and 512MB RAM per task)*

*   **Run a command directly on node2 (Systemd fallback, no Docker):**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client --target node2 --container NULL -- df -h /
    ```

*   **Run a Systemd task bound to NUMA node 0 on node1:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client --target node1:0 --container NULL --cores 4 -- ./run_numa_benchmark.sh
    ```

*   **Run a GPU task on node3 using devices 0 and 1:**
    ```bash
    hakuriver.client --target node3::0,1 --container my-cuda-env -- python /shared/train_gpu_model.py
    ```
    *(Note: GPU allocation currently requires a Docker container environment, not Systemd fallback)*

HakuRiver includes an optional Vue.js dashboard for visual monitoring and management.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm.
*   Running HakuRiver Host accessible from where you run the frontend dev server.

**Setup:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Running (Development):**

1.  Ensure Host is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
2.  Start Vite dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open the URL provided (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
4.  The dev server proxies `/api` requests to the Host (see `vite.config.js`).
5.  **Features:**
    *   View node list, status, resources, NUMA topology, and **GPU details**.
    *   View task list, details (incl. Batch ID, Target NUMA, Required GPUs, Container).
    *   Submit new tasks using a form (allows **multi-target** selection including node, NUMA, and **GPU selection**, and **Docker container** selection).
    *   Kill/Pause/Resume running tasks.
    *   View task stdout/stderr logs (via log modals).
    *   Access interactive terminal in Host containers (via terminal modal).

**Building (Production):**

1.  Build static files:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  Serve the contents of `frontend/dist` using any static web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.).
3.  **Important:** Configure your production web server to proxy API requests (e.g., requests to `/api/*`) to the actual running HakuRiver Host address and port, OR modify `src/services/api.js` to use the Host's absolute URL before building.

## 📝 Future Work / TODO

*   **NUMA Awareness within Docker:** Implement mechanisms to pass NUMA binding preferences (`--cpuset-cpus`, `--cpuset-mems`) to `docker run` based on the `--target node:numa_id` syntax.
*   **Basic Scheduling Strategies:** Explore other simple but useful options beyond simple "first fit" for node selection. Such as round-robin, least loaded, priority-based, etc.
