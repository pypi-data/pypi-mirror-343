# 🥦 Nutritionix MCP Server

This is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for integrating with the [Nutritionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/), enabling AI agents to access food search, nutrition data, and exercise calorie estimates via natural language input.

The goal of this project is to expose Nutritionix's functionality through MCP-compatible tools that can be used seamlessly by large language models and agent frameworks.

## 🧠 What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a lightweight protocol designed to let **AI agents interact with external tools and APIs** in a structured and modular way. Think of it like **USB for AI** — this server acts as a "driver" for the Nutritionix platform.

With this MCP server, AI models can:

- 🔍 Search for common and branded food items  
- 🍽️ Parse natural language meals into nutritional breakdowns  
- 🏃 Estimate calories burned from exercises like running, cycling, or yoga

## 🚀 How to Run

> 🛠️ **Coming soon:** Full setup and run instructions will be added here, including:
- Required dependencies
- API key setup (`--app-id`, `--app-key`)
- CLI usage examples
- MCP protocol transport details (e.g. `stdio`, `http`)
