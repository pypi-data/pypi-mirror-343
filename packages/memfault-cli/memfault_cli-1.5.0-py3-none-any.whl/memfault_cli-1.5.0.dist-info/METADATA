              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# Memfault CLI tool

This package contains the `memfault` CLI tool.

The purpose of the tool is to make integration with Memfault from other systems,
like continuous integration servers, as easy as possible.

Install the tool and run `memfault --help` for more info!

## Changes

### [1.5.0] - 2024-11-14

- Add support for Python 3.13: remove unnecessary version constraints on the
  `chardet` + `lxml` dependencies.

### [1.4.0] - 2024-11-12

- Populate a User-Agent string in the headers of all requests to Memfault Cloud
  to identify the CLI version used for diagnostics. Previously the User-Agent
  was only included for chunk POST requests.

### [1.3.0] - 2024-11-07

- Remove support for Python 3.6 + 3.7

### [1.2.0] - 2024-08-28

- Add the `upload-software-version-sbom` command. Look at the
  [SBOM docs](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/sbom) for more info.

### [1.1.0] - 2024-07-22

- Add a user-agent string to chunk POST requests to identify CLI version used
  for diagnostics.

- Fixups with ruff (RET504)

### [1.0.11] - 2024-06-28

- Add an option `--no-check-uploaded` for `upload-mcu-symbols` to skip an
  initial check if the symbol file already exists. This option should be used
  with Org Tokens limited to only uploading symbol file

- Bump urllib3 dependency to 1.26.19

- Fixups with ruff 0.4.10

### [1.0.10] - 2024-06-13

- Source pyelftools from <https://pypi.org/project/pyelftools/> again, as the
  required bugfixes have been merged upstream. See notes of 1.0.6 below.

### [1.0.9] - 2024-04-04

- Add Miniterm help text when launching the `memfault console` command, to
  indicate how to exit the console (`Ctrl-]`).

### 1.0.8

- Add Apache 2 license

### 1.0.7

- Fix bug when deactivating delta releases when multiple deployments match the
  filters.

### 1.0.6

- Source pyelftools from <https://github.com/memfault/pyelftools> while we are
  waiting for 2 bugfixes to get merged upstream
  (<https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools/pull/537> and
  <https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools/pull/538>).

### 1.0.5

- Add support for deactivating delta releases.

### 1.0.4

- Add `upload-elf-symbols` command for uploading ELF files with debug symbols
  built outside of a Yocto environment
- Add `upload-elf-coredump` for uploading a Linux coredump to Memfault

### 1.0.3

- Fix a bug where `upload-aosp-symbols` would fail when uploading too many files
  at once.

### 1.0.2

- Fix a bug where `upload-yocto-symbols` would fail when some files in the
  tarballs provided did not have the read permission set.

### 1.0.1

- Fix `upload-custom-data-recording` to print a more helpful error message when
  exceeding device rate limits.

### 1.0.0

_Note: this release is marked as `1.0.0` but does not contain any breaking
changes! The version number was bumped to reflect the maturity of the tool._

- Fix `upload-mcu-symbols` to skip uploading if the symbol file has already been
  uploaded, and return a zero exit code in this case

### 0.18.1

- Add the `--deactivate` option to `deploy-release`, which disables a release
  for a cohort

### 0.18.0

- Add new `extra-metadata` option to `upload-ota-payload` to attach custom
  metadata to that OTA release. The metadata will be returned from Memfault
  Cloud when fetching the latest Android OTA release.
- Continue uploading the entire folder of symbols even if any single upload
  fails due to the symbol file being too large.

### 0.17.0

- Add new `console` command to read SDK exported chunks via a serial port and
  automatically upload to Memfault.

### 0.16.0

- Add support for uploading Android debug symbols from alternative build
  systems.

### 0.15.3

- Warn if a non-slug string is passed to the `--project` or `--org` arguments

### 0.15.2

- Don't truncate help output from `click` when the `CI` environment variable is
  set, for consistent output formatting

### 0.15.1

- Fix some compatibility issues for python3.6 + python3.7

### 0.15.0

- 💥 Breaking change: update the `upload-yocto-symbols` subcommand to take two
  image paths as required arguments; one for the root filesystem image, and
  another for the debug filesystem image. Versions 0.14.0 and lower used to take
  a guess at the path of the debug filesystem image from the value passed to the
  `--image` param. To avoid confusion and to support all configurations, the
  Memfault CLI no longer does any guessing and now takes two separate params:
  `--image` and `--dbg-image`

### 0.14.0

- ✨ Update the `post-chunk` subcommand to split uploads into batches of 500
  chunks per upload, to avoid timing out when uploading very large chunk logs

### 0.13.0

- 💥 Breaking change: Renamed subcommand `upload-debug-data-recording` to
  `custom-data-recording`

### 0.12.0

- ✨ Added subcommand `upload-debug-data-recording` for uploading debug data
  files

### 0.11.0

- ✨ Enable support for Yocto Dunfell based projects (previously supported
  Kirkstone only)

### 0.10.0

- ✨ Upload-yocto-symbols now uploads additional symbol files

### 0.9.0

- ✨ Expanded support for .elf uploading with the upload-yocto-symbols
  subcommand

### 0.8.0

- ✨ Initial support for upload-yocto-symbols subcommand

### 0.7.0

- 🐛 Updated to correctly only use the GNU build-id `.note` section
